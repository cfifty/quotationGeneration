"And I assert that no opinion of his ever carried more authority with it; and that no eloquence of his was ever more agreeable.",
"With what silent attention were the other chief men of the city listened to while speaking in my behalf; whom I do not mention in this place, only lest my speech, if I say too little of any one,  should seem ungrateful, and, if I were to say enough of each individual, interminable.",
"Turn now to the harangue of that same enemy of mine concerning me, the same person of whom those great men had been speaking, delivered in the Campus Martius, to a genuine assembly of the people.",
"Who was there who (I will not say approved of it, but who) did not think it a most scandalous thing that he should be allowed to live and breathe at all, much less to speak?",
"Who was there who did not think that the republic was polluted by his voice, and that he himself, if he only listened to him, was implicated in his wickedness?",
"I come now to the comitia, whether those for electing magistrates or for enacting laws.",
"We often see many laws passed.",
"I say nothing of those which are passed in such a manner that scarcely five men, and those only of the lowest class, can be found to give a vote for them.",
"He says that at the time of that ruin of the republic he carried a law respecting me, whom he called a tyrant, and the destroyer of liberty.",
"Who is there who will confess that he gave a vote when this law was passed against me?",
"But when, in compliance with the same resolution of the senate, a law was passed about me in the comitia centuriata, who is there who does not profess that then he was present, and that he gave a vote in favour of my safety?",
"Which cause, then, is the one which ought to appear popular?",
"that in which everything that is honourable in the city, and every age, and every rank of men agree?",
"or that to the carrying of which some excited Furies fly as if hastening to banquet on the funeral of the republic?",
"Suppose Gellius is present anywhere, a man unworthy of his brother, who is a most illustrious citizen, and has been a most excellent consul, and of the equestrian order, of which he retains the name, though he has squandered the fortune which entitled him to it;honor will his presence make an assembly a popular one?",
"For, to be sure, he is a man quite devoted to the Roman people.",
"I never saw one more so.",
"Why, even  when, in his youth, he might have shared to some extent in the credit arising from the ample honours of that most admirable man, Lucius Philippus, his step-father, he was so far from being fond of the people, that he devoured the whole of his property by himself.",
"Afterwards, from having been a profligate and licentious young man, after he had brought down his paternal property from the easy circumstances in which stupid people take delight, to the strict rule of philosophers, he wished to be considered a man of Greek learning, and a quiet scholar, and on a sudden devoted himself to the study of literature.",
"But his old Greeks did not do him much good; his slaves who read to him, and his books, were often pledged for wine; his appetite was as insatiable as ever; but his resources fell short enough.",
"Therefore he was perpetually occupied with thoughts of revolution; he was growing old and weary of the peace and tranquillity of the republic.",
"Has there ever been any sedition of which he has not been a prime mover?",
"Has there ever been any seditious man with whom he has not been intimate?",
"Has there ever been any turbulent assembly of which he has not been an exciter?",
"Has he ever spoken well of any good man?",
"Spoken well, do I say?",
"Ay, rather, is there any brave and good citizen whom he has not attacked in the most wanton manner?",
"A fellow whonot, I fancy, out of any desire, but merely in order to seem a favourer of the common peopletook a freedwoman for his wife.",
"He voted concerning me; he was present at the assembly; he was present at all the banquets and mutual congratulations of that parricidal crew.",
"However, he avenged me well when he kissed my enemies with that impure mouth of his.",
"For, just as if it were owing to me that he has lost his property, he is an enemy to me on that very account, because he has nothing left.",
"Have I, O Gellius, taken your patrimony from you, or have you devoured it?",
"What?",
"Were you, you gulf and whirlpool of your patrimony, were you gormandising at my risk, when you wished to prevent me from remaining any longer in the city, because as consul I had defended the republic against you and your associates?",
"There is not one of your family who can bear the sight of you.",
"All men avoid your approach, your conversation, your society.",
"Postumius, the son of your sister, a young man of great prudence and high character, with the judgment of an old  man, branded you, when amid a great number of guardians he did not appoint you as one of the guardians of his children.",
"But I have been carried away by indignation on my own account and on that of the republic, (and I do not know which of us two he hates most,) to say more than I need have said against that most frantic and impoverished glutton.",
"I return to my original subject; that, when the proceedings were being carried on against me, while the city was taken and oppressed, Gellius, and Firmius, and Titius, all Furies of the same class, were the chiefs and leaders of those mercenary bands, while the proposer of the law himself was in no respect free from being implicated in their baseness, and audacity, and iniquity.",
"But when the law was passed for my restoration to my dignity, no one thought that either infirm health or old age supplied him with any reasonable excuse for being absent; there was no one who did not consider that by his vote he was recalling not only me, but also the republic at the same time to its ancient position.",
"Let us now consider the comitia held for the election of magistrates.",
"There was lately a college of tribunes, among whom three were considered not at all attached to the party of the people; but three were supposed to be most violently so.",
"Of those who were not considered friends of the people, and who were unable to stand before a packed and bribed assembly of that sort, I see that two have been made praetors by the Roman people; and, as far as I have been able to understand, by the conversation of the common people and by their votes, the Roman people openly alleged that the consistent and illustrious courage exhibited by Cnaeus Domitius in his tribuneship, and the good faith and fortitude of Quintus Ancharius, would have been pleasing to them for the mere good-will which it proved, even if they had not been able to effect anything.",
"We see, now, what is the opinion which is entertained of Caius Fannius; and what the opinion of the Roman people is likely to be when he seeks for honours, ought to be doubtful to no one.",
"What more shall I say?",
"How did those two friends of the people fare?",
"One, who however had put some restraint on himself, had proposed no law; he had merely entertained very different sentiments respecting the republic from those which men expected of him, as he  had been a virtuous and innocent man, and one at all times esteemed by virtuous men; but as in his tribuneship he had shown himself very little able to comprehend what was approved by the genuine body of the people, and because he imagined that that was the Roman people which attended those assemblies, he did not attain that honour at which he would easily have arrived, if he had not hunted so much after popularity.",
"The other, who was so frantic in his desire for popularity, that he thought neither the auspices, nor the Aelian law, nor the authority of the senate, nor the consul, nor his colleagues, nor the estimation of good men, of any importance at all, stood for the aedileship along with some virtuous men of the highest character, but still not men in the first rank for riches and personal influence; and did not get the vote of even his own tribe.",
"He lost also the vote of the Palatine tribe, by the assistance of which it used to be said that all those pests were able to annoy the Roman people; and, indeed, (as was very acceptable to all good men,) he got nothing but repulses at that comitia.",
"You see, therefore, that the very people itselfif I may use such an expressionis not for a seeker after popularity, since it so vehemently rejects those men who are accounted popular characters, and considers those men the most worthy of honour who are the most opposed to that class of men.",
"Let us now come to the games.",
"For the way in which I see your attention given to me, and your eyes directed towards me, makes me think that I may be allowed now to speak in a lighter tone.",
"At times the intimations of opinion which take place in assemblies and comitia are to be depended on; at times they are worthless and corrupt.",
"The crowd of spectators in the theatre and at the gladiatorial games, are said at all times to pour forth their purchased applauses in small and scanty proportion at the caprice of a few directors.",
"But it is easy, when that is the case, to see how it is done, and by whom, and what the entire people are doing.",
"Why need I tell you now what men, or what description of citizens, receive the greatest applause?",
"There is not one of you who is ignorant of this.",
"However, let this be a matter of slight consequence, not that it really is, since it is given to every virtuous man; but, if it be a matter of slight consequence, it  is so only to a wise man.",
"But to him who depends on the most trivial circumstances, who (as these men say themselves) is fettered and guided by popular rumour and popular favour, it is inevitable that applause must appear immortality, and hissing death.",
"I, then, ask you, above all men, O Scaurus,you who have exhibited the most splendid and magnificent games of all men,whether any one of those popular characters was ever a spectator of your games?",
"whether any one of them ever trusted himself to the theatre and to the Roman people?",
"That very chief buffoon of all, that man who was not only spectator, but at the same time actor and spouter,that man who filled up all his sister's interludes, who is introduced into companies of women as a singing-girl,neither ventured to go to see your games in that furious tribuneship of his, nor any other games either, except those from which he had some difficulty in escaping with his life.",
"Once altogether, I say, did that popular man venture to trust himself among the spectators of the games; when in the temple of Honour and Virtue honour was paid to virtue, and when the monument of Caius Marius, the preserver of this empire, had afforded a place in which the citizens could provide for the safety of a man who was a fellow-citizen of his own municipal town, and a defender of the republic.",
"And at that time it was shown plainly enough, with reference to both parties, what were the real feelings of the Roman people; in the first place, when, after having heard the resolution of the senate, universal applause was given to the proposer of the law, and to the senate as a body, though it was not present; and secondly, when every individual senator, as he returned from the senate to see the games, was received with loud clapping of hands.",
"But, when the consul himself, who was exhibiting the games, took his seat, then the people stood up, thanking him with extended hands, and with tears of joy declared their good-will towards and pity for me.",
"But, when that furious enemy of mine, with his senseless and frantic mind, arrived, the Roman people could hardly restrain itself; the men could hardly abstain from wreaking their hatred on his foul and wicked person.",
"Words, indeed, and menacing gestures of the hands, and loud outcries in the way of abuse and of curses on him, were universal.",
"But why need I speak of the disposition and courage of the Roman people, looking back on their liberty after their long slavery, as shown by their conduct towards that man, whom, though he was at that time standing for the aedileship, even the actors did not spare to his face.",
"For as the play being exhibited was one of Roman life,"The Pretender,"honor I believe,the whole troop of actors, speaking in most splendid concert, and looking in the face of this profligate man, laid the greatest emphasis on the words, "To such a life as yours," and, "The continued course and end of your wicked life."",
"He sat frightened out of his wits; and he, who formerly used to pack the assemblies which he summoned with bands of noisy buffoons, was now driven away by the voices of these same players.",
"And since I have mentioned the games, I will not omit that circumstance, that amid the great variety of sentences and apophthegms which occur in that play, there was not one passage in which any expression of the poet had any bearing on our times, which either escaped the notice of the main body of the people, or on which particular emphasis was not laid by the actor.",
"And I entreat you, while speaking on this topic, O judges, not to think that I am led by any levity of disposition to an unusual description of oratory, if in a court of justice I speak of poets, and actors, and games.",
"I am not, O judges, so ignorant of the forms of proceeding in trials, I am not so inexperienced in speaking, as to hunt for topics of every sort, and to gather and taste every sort of flower from every quarter.",
"I know what is due to your dignity, and to my duty as counsel for the defence, and to this court, and to the character of Publius Sextius, and to the magnitude of his danger, and to my own age and to my own honour.",
"But I have considered that while speaking on this point, it was desirable to explain to the youth of the city who were the best men.",
"And in explaining that point, it was necessary to show that those men are not all friends of the people who are thought to be so.",
"And that I can do most easily, if I represent to them the genuine and unbribed opinion of the Roman people, and the real inmost feelings of the citizens.",
"How was it that,when the news of that resolution of the senate which was passed in the temple of Virtue was fresh, and was brought to the people while engaged in beholding the games, and to the actors on the stage, in a very full house,that consummate actor, a man, in truth, who always performs the best part in the republic as he does on the stage, weeping both from recent joy and also from a mixture of grief and regret for me, pleaded my cause before the Roman people in much more impressive language than I could possibly have pleaded for myself?",
"For he gave a representation of the genius of the great poet whose play was being acted, not merely by his art as an actor, but by his real grief.",
""What, shall he who with a constant mind assisted and supported the state; who has always stood on the side of the Greeks " He said that I had always stood on your side; he pointed to your ranks; he was encored by every body.",
""Who, in a critical state of affairs, did not hesitate to expose his life, did not spare his own person or privileges ."",
"What shouts were raised as he recited these passages!",
"when, omitting all consideration of his acting, the people applauded the words of the poet and the zeal of the actor, and the encouragement of their expectations respecting me.",
""A most excellent friend, in a most important war :" for the actor added that of himself, from his friendly inclination towards me; and perhaps men applauded it on account of their regret for me: "A man endowed with the highest ability."",
"Then came those words, in the same play, with what groans on the part of the Roman people were they accompanied when the actor repeated them!",
""Oh, my father ."",
"He thought me,me I say, deserving to be lamented as his father, whom Quintus Catulus, and whom many other men had repeatedly styled in the senate the Father of my country.",
"With what great weeping for my ruin and for the conflagration of my property were his words accompanied, when he deplored his father driven away, his country afflicted, his house burnt and destroyed.",
"He acted in such a manner, when, after having dilated on his former fortune, he turned his description in this way, "All these things have I seen destroyed by fire ," as to rouse the tears of even my enemies and my enviers.",
"O ye immortal gods!",
"what did he do next?",
"in  what way did he pronounce the next words?",
"which indeed seem to me to have been acted and written in such a manner, that they might appropriately have been uttered even by Catulus himself, if he had come to life again; for he was accustomed at times to reprove and attack the precipitate counsels of the people, and the blunders of the senate as well, with great freedom.",
""O ungrateful Argives; empty-headed Greeks; forgetful of kindness!"",
"That, indeed, was not true; for they were not ungrateful, but miserable in not being allowed to secure the safety of that man from whom they had received their own: nor was any body ever more grateful to another than all of them were to me.",
"But still what that most eloquent poet wrote was applicable to me; and that not only best but also boldest of actors applied it to me, when he pointed at all orders of citizens, and accused the senate, the Roman knights, and the whole Roman people: "You allow him to be banished, you have voted for his being driven away, you endure his being driven away."",
"I myself only know by report what indications every one then gave of their feelings on that occasion, and how universally the whole Roman people declared their inclinations towards a man who had never sought to curry favour with the people; but they can judge more accurately of that who were present.",
"And since my speech has carried me on to this point, the actor bewailed my misfortune so repeatedly, while he was pleading my cause so mournfully, that his beautiful voice was hindered by his tears.",
"Nor were the poets, whose genius I have always had an affection for, wanting to my necessities at that time, and the Roman people approved of their words, not only with their applause, but even with their groans.",
"Ought then Aesop or Accius to have said these things on my behalf if the Roman people had been free, or ought they to have left them to the chief men of the state to say?",
"In the Brutus, I was mentioned by name: "Tullius, who had established the liberty of the citizens."",
"It was encored again and again.",
"Did the Roman people appear to be giving slight indications that it had been established by me and by the senate, though profligate citizens accused us as having destroyed it?",
"But above all other times the sentiments of the entire Roman people were declared at the  exhibition of the gladiatorial games.",
"For they were the gift of Scipio, worthy both of him and Quintus Metellus, in whose honour they were given.",
"And they are a spectacle of that sort which is attended by immense numbers and by every class of men, and with which the multitude is delighted above all things.",
"Into that crowd of spectators came Publius Sextius as tribune of the people, when during his whole period of office he had been nothing whatever but serving my cause; and he went among the people, not from any personal desire of applause, but that our enemies might themselves see the inclinations of the universal people.",
"He came, as you know, to the Maenian pillar, and such great applause ensued, from all the places for beholding the spectacle all the way from the Capitol, and such universal clapping of hands from every seat, that it was said that there had never been, in any cause whatever, greater or more manifest unanimity on the part of the Roman people.",
"Where at that time were those regulators of the assemblies, those masters of the laws, those expellers of citizens?",
"Or have these wicked men any peculiar people of their own to whom we have given offence, and by whom we are hated?",
"I think, indeed, that there never was a time when the people were assembled in greater crowds, than that time of those gladiatorial games; neither at any assembly, nor even at any comitia.",
"What then did this innumerable multitude of men, this extraordinary indication of the will of the entire Roman people, without the slightest disagreement, on those very days when it was thought that my cause was going to be decided, declare, except that the safety and dignity of the best citizens was dear to the entire Roman people?",
"But that tribune of the people, who was accustomed to put questions to the assembly, not according to the usual custom of his father, or his grandfather, or his great grandfather, or of any of his ancestors, but like a Greek schoolmaster, "Did they wish me to return?"",
"and when an outcry was raised against it by the faint voices of his hirelings, he said that the Roman people affirmed that they had no such wish,he, though he used to go and see the gladiators every day, was never seen when he did come.",
"He used to emerge on a sudden after he had crept along under the benches, so that he seemed as if he were going to say,  "Mother, I call you.",
""honor And so that dark way by which he used to come to see the games was called the Appian Road.",
"But still, the moment the people got sight of him, not only the gladiators, but the very horses of the gladiators, were frightened at the sudden hisses that ensued.",
"Do you not see, then, what a great difference there is between the Roman people and an assembly?",
"Do you not see that the masters of the assemblies are the object of the hatred of the Roman people?",
"and that those who are not permitted to appear without insult in the assembly of artisans, are honoured by every possible mark of respect by the Roman people?",
"Do you speak to me of Marcus Atilius Regulus, who of his own accord preferred returning to Carthage to execution, to remaining at Rome without those prisoners by whom he had been sent to the Senate, and then do you deny that I ought to be anxious for a recal procured by means of trained households of slaves and bands of armed men?",
"Certainly, I suppose I was anxious for violence, who, as long as there was any violence going on, did nothing whatever, and who could not possibly have been undermined and injured if it had not been for violence.",
"Was I to regret such a recal as this, which was so honourable to me that I am almost afraid of seeming to have left the city from a covetousness of glory, in order to return in such a manner?",
"For what citizen except me did the senate ever recommend to the protection of foreign nations?",
"For whose safety except mine did the senate ever publicly return thanks to the allies of the Roman people?",
"I am the only person concerning whom the conscript fathers ever decreed that whoever went in command to any of the provinces, whoever were quaestors or lieutenants, were to take care of my safety and my life.",
"Mine is the only cause since the foundation of the city in which every one who had any regard for the safety of the republic was summoned to Rome from every part of Italy, by letters written by the consuls in obedience to a resolution of the senate.",
"That which the senate never once decreed at a time of peril to the entire republic, they thought it necessary to decree for the preservation of my individual safety.",
"Who was  ever more regretted in the senate house?",
"who was ever more lamented in the forum?",
"who was ever so much missed in the courts of justice?",
"At, and in consequence of my departure, every place immediately became deserted, melancholy, mute, full of grief and lamentation.",
"What spot is there in all Italy in which there is not imprinted on the public monuments some proof of the zeal of the people for my safety, some testimony to my worth?",
"For why should I mention those resolutions of the senate, of more than human kindness towards me?",
"Either that which was passed in the temple of the all-good and all-powerful Jupiter, when that man, who has marked by three triumphs that he has added himself three countries and nations to this empire, read a long written speech in support of his opinion, and bore his testimony to the fact that I alone had preserved the country; and the senate in the fullest possible house adopted his opinion so entirely that only one enemy of mine dissented from it, and the decree, as supported by Pompeius, was recorded in the public registers for the eternal recollection of posterity?",
"Or that which was passed the next day in the senate-house, at the suggestion of the Roman people themselves, and of those men who had come up from the municipal towns, to the effect that no one was to observe the heavens, that no one was to cause any delay whatever; that if any one did so, he should be considered at once as one who wished to overturn the republic, and the senate would be very much offended, and that a motion should be immediately made respecting his conduct?",
"And when the senate, meeting in great numbers, had checked the wickedness and audacity of some of those men by its authority and dignity, it added this clause moreover, that if within the next five days in which my affairs could be discussed, they were not brought to a termination, I was to return to my country and be restored to all my former dignities.",
"The senate decreed at the same time that thanks should be given to those men who had come up from all parts of Italy for the sake of my safety; and that they should be requested to come again when the consideration of the subject was renewed.",
"And there was such a rivalry between all people to show their zeal for my safety, that the very men to  whom entreaties were addressed in my behalf by that senate, did also themselves address entreaties to the senate respecting me; and, accordingly, in all those transactions but one man alone was found who openly dissented from this earnest unanimity of all good men, so that even Quintus Metellus, the consul, who had been in a very great degree an enemy to me in the violent party contests which had arisen about political affairs, himself made a motion in favour of my safety.",
"And when he, being roused up by the exceeding authority of Publius Servilius, and also by a certain energy which gave weight to his eloquence, when he had invoked all the Metelli from the shades below, and had diverted the thoughts of his relation from the piratical attempts of Clodius to the dignity of that family by which they were connected together; and when he had brought him back to the recollection of their great domestic example and to the fate (shall I call it glorious, or melancholy?)",
"of that great man Metellus Numidicus; then, I say, that illustrious man,that genuine Metellus wept, and gave himself up from that moment to Publius Servilius even before he had come to the end of his speech.",
"Nor could he, as a man of the same illustrious family, withstand that godlike dignity of eloquence so pregnant with the virtues of old time, and, though I was absent, he still became reconciled to me from that moment.",
"And certainly, if it be the case that illustrious men retain any sense or feeling after death, then he did a thing which was most acceptable to all the Metelli, and, above all, to that bravest of men and best of citizens, his own brother, the companion of all my labours, and dangers, and counsels.",
"But who is there who is ignorant of what a triumphant return mine was?",
"how the people of Brundusium held out to me on my arrival the right hand, as it were, of all Italy, and of my country herself; and when the same day, the fifth of August, was the day of my arrival, and also the birthday of my dearest daughter, whom I then beheld for the first time after our long regret for one another, and our mourning; and was also the day consecrated as the day of the foundation of that very colony of Brundusium; and also the anniversary of the dedication of the temple of Salus, as you know.",
"And when I had been received into the joyful house of those most excellent and learned men, Laenius  Flaccus and his father and brother, which had received me with tears the year before, when I was leaving Italy, and had defended me not without risk and danger to itself; and when along my whole road all the cities of Italy seemed to be keeping the days of my arrival as days of festivity; and the roads themselves were filled with a multitude of deputies sent from all quarters; and there was a vast throng of men crowding towards the city, full of exultation and congratulation to me; and my whole path up from the gate of the city, my ascent to the Capitol, and my return to my house, was of such a nature, that amid my excessive joy I grieved also that so grateful a city should be so miserable and so ill-treated.",
"You now, then, have an answer to the question which you put to mewho were the best men?",
"They are not a race, as you termed them; an expression which I recognised at once, for it was one invented by that man by whom, above all others, Publius Sextius sees himself opposed,by that man who has wished the whole of this race of Romans destroyed and slaughtered,who has constantly reproached and constantly attacked Caius Caesar, a very mild-tempered man and very averse to bloodshed, asserting that he, as long as that race lived, would never be free from anxiety.",
"He gained nothing by his attacks on the whole body, but he never ceased to urge the point against me.",
"He attacked me first of all by the instrumentality of the informer Vettius, to whom he put questions in the assembly, concerning me, and concerning the most illustrious men in the state.",
"But while doing this, he joined those citizens in the same danger with me, bringing forward the same accusations against them, so as to deserve great gratitude from me for connecting me with the most honourable and bravest of men.",
"But afterwards he in a most wicked manner contrived all sorts of plots against me, for no provocation which I had given him, except inasmuch as I was anxious to please all virtuous men.",
"He was every day mentioning some fault of mine to those men whom he could get to listen to him; he warned the man who was of all others the most friendly to me, Cnaeus Pompeius, to beware of entering my house, and to be on his guard against me; he united himself with my chief enemy, in such a manner that he said, with respect to that proscription of mine which Sextus Clodius, a fellow thoroughly worthy of his  associates, promoted, that he was the tablet on which it was written, and that he himself was the writer.",
"And he alone of our whole order openly exulted at my departure and at your grief.",
"And I, for my part, O judges, though he was every day attacking me, never said one word against him; nor did I think, while I was being attacked by every sort of engine and weapon of violence, and an army, and a mob, that it was suited to my dignity to complain of one archer more.",
"He says that my acts displease him.",
"Who doubts that?",
"when he despises that law which expressly forbids any one to exhibit shows of gladiators within two years of his having stood, or being about to stand, for any office.",
"And in that, O judges, I cannot sufficiently marvel at his rashness.",
"He acts most openly against the law; and he does so, who is a man who is neither able to slip out of the consequences of a trial by his pleasant manner, nor to struggle out of them by his popularity, nor to break down the laws and courts of justice by his wealth and influence.",
"What can induce the fellow to be so intemperate?",
"I imagine it is out of his excessive covetousness of popularity, that he bought that troop of gladiators, so beautiful, noble, and magnificent.",
"He knew the inclination of the people, he saw that great clamours and gatherings of the people would ensue.",
"And elated with this expectation, and burning with a desire of glory, he could not restrain himself from bringing forward those gladiators, of whom he himself was the finest specimen.",
"If that were the motive for his violation of the law, and if he were prompted by zeal to please the people on account of the recent kindness of the Roman people to himself, still no one would pardon him; but as the fact is that this band did not consist of men picked out of those who were for sale, but of men bought out of gaols, and adorned with gladiatorial names, while he drew lots to see whom he would call Samnites, and whom Challengers, who could avoid having fears as to what might be the end of such licentiousness and such undisguised contempt for the laws?",
"But he brings forward two arguments in his defence.",
"First of all, "I exhibit," says he, "men fighting with beasts, and the law only speaks of gladiators."",
"A very clever idea!",
"Listen now to a statement which is still more ingenious.",
"He says  that he has not exhibited gladiators, but one single gladiator; and that he has limited the whole of his aedileship to this one exhibition.",
"A fine aedileship truly.",
"One lion, two hundred men who fight with beasts.",
"However, let him urge this defence.",
"I wish him to feel confidence in his case; for he is in the habit of appealing to the tribunes of the people, and to use violent means to upset those tribunals in which he has not confidence.",
"And I do not so much wonder that he despises my law, as having been framed by a man whom he considers his enemy, as at his having made up his mind to regard no law whatever which has been passed by a consul.",
"He despises the Caecilian Didian law, and the Licinian Junian law.",
"Does he also deny that the law of Caius Caesar,who he is in the habit of boasting has been adorned and strengthened and armed by his law, and by his kindness, respecting extortion and corruption,is a law?",
"And do they complain that there are other men, too, who wish to rescind the acts of Caesar, while this most excellent law is neglected by his father-in-law and by this slave?",
"And the prosecutor has dared, while pleading in this cause, to exhort you, O judges, to show at last some severity, and at length to apply some healing measures to the republic.",
"But that is not a remedy when the knife is applied to some sound and healthy part of the body; that is the act of an executioner, and mere inhumanity.",
"Those are the men who really apply healing remedies to the republic, who cut out some pestilence as if it were a wen on the person of the state.",
"But in order that my speech may have some termination, and that I may cease speaking before you are weary of listening to me with attention, I will finish my argument about the party of the best men, and about their leaders, and about those who are the chief defenders of the republic.",
"I will stir you up, O young men, especially you who are of noble birth, to the imitation of your ancestors, and I will exhort you who have the opportunity of arriving at high rank by the exercise of genius and virtue, to adopt that line of conduct by which many new men have become crowned with honour and glory.",
"This, believe me, is the only path to praise, and dignity, and honour,to be praised and beloved by men who are wise and good, and endowed with good dispositions by nature; to  become acquainted with the constitution of the state, as it has been most wisely established by our ancestors, who, when they could no longer endure the power of a king, created annual magistrates on the principle of making the senate the perpetual supreme council of the republic, and of allowing men to be elected into that body by the whole people, and of opening the road to that supreme order to the industry and virtue of all the citizens.",
"They established the senate as the guardian, and president, and protector of the republic; they chose the magistrates to depend on the authority of this order, and to be as it were the ministers of this most dignified council; and they contrived that the senate itself should be strengthened by the high respectability of those ranks which came nearest to it, and so be able to defend and promote the liberties and interests of the common people.",
"Those who defend these institutions with all their might are the best men, of whatever rank they are; and they who chiefly support all these offices and the republic on their necks as it were, are accounted the chiefs of the party of the best men,the chief advisers and preservers of the state.",
"I confess that there are, as I have said before, many adversaries and enemies to, and enviers of this class of men, that there are many dangers in their path, that many injuries are heaped upon them, that many labours have necessarily to be experienced and undergone by them.",
"But all my speech is addressed to virtue, and not to sloth; to dignity, and not to luxury; to those men who look upon themselves as born for their country, for their fellow-citizens, for praise, for glory, not for sleep, for banquets, and soft delights.",
"For if there be any men who are influenced wholly by pleasures, and who have given themselves entirely up to the seductions of vices and to the gratification of their desires, let them abandon all desire for honours; let them abstain from meddling with the republic; let them be satisfied with enjoying their ease, and owing it to the labour of virtuous and brave men.",
"But they who desire the good report of good men, which is the only thing which is really entitled to be called glory, ought to seek ease and pleasures for others and not for themselves.",
"They must toil for the common advantage; they must incur enmities, and often encounter tempests, for the sake of the republic; they must combat with many audacious and wicked  men.sometimes even with men of great influence.",
"This is what we have heard of the sentiments and actions of the most illustrious men; this is what tradition reports of them, and what we have read: nor do we ever see those men loaded with praise who from time to time have stirred up the minds of men to sedition, or who by bribery have corrupted the inclinations of the ignorant, or who have brought brave and illustrious men, who have deserved well of the republic, into odium and unpopularity.",
"Our countrymen have always thought such men as those contemptible, and audacious, and wicked, and mischievous citizens.",
"But they who have checked the violence and the attempts of those men; they who by their authority, by their integrity, by their firmness, and by their magnanimity have resisted the designs of audacious men, have been at all times considered wise and good men, the chiefs, and leaders, and advisers of this order, of this dignified body, and of the empire.",
"And let no one, on account of what has happened to me, or perhaps to one or two others besides, fear to adopt this plan of life.",
"One man in this state, whom I can mention, a man who had done great services to the republic, Lucius Opimius, did fall in a most shameful manner.",
"And if his grave is a deserted one on the shore of Dyrrachium, he has a most superb monument in our forum.",
"And the Roman people itself at all times delivered him from danger, though he was exceedingly unpopular with the mob on account of the death of Caius Gracchus; and it was a storm coming from another quarterfrom an iniquitous judicial decisionwhich crushed that illustrious citizen.",
"But the other men who have done good service to the state, have either, if for a while they have been stricken by any sudden violence, or tempest of popular odium, been restored again, and recalled by the people of its own accord, or else they have passed their whole lives without any such injuries or attacks.",
"But they who have disregarded the wisdom of the senate, and the authority of good men, and the established rules of our ancestors, and have sought to become agreeable to an ignorant and excited multitude, have nearly all suffered just retribution and made atonement to the republic, either by instant death, or shameful exile.",
"But if, even among the Athenians, a nation of Greeks, far removed from the serious wisdom of our ancestors, there were  not wanting men to defend the republic against the rashness of the people;though every one who ever did so was sure to be banished from the city;if the great Themistocles, the preserver of his country, was not deterred from defending the republic, either by the calamity of Miltiades, who had saved that state only a little before, or by the banishment of Aristides, who is said to have been the greatest of all men: and if, after his time, many illustrious men of the same state, whom it is unnecessary for me to mention by name, in spite of the numerous instances of the popular ill-temper and fickleness which they had before them, still defended that republic of theirs; what ought we to do, who, in the first place, have been born in that city which appears to me to be the very birth-place of wisdom and dignity and magnanimity; and who, in the second place, are raised on such a pinnacle of glory that all human things may well appear insignificant by the side of it; and who, lastly, have undertaken to uphold that republic, which is one of such dignity, that to slay a man who is defending it is no less a crime than to attack it and to endeavour to seize the supreme power?",
"Those Greeks whom I have just mentioned, having been unjustly condemned and banished by their fellow-citizens, still, because they deserved well of their state, enjoy such renown at this present time, not in Greece alone, but among ourselves also, and in other lands, that no one ever mentions the names of those men by whom they were oppressed, and that every one prefers their disasters to the superior power of their enemies.",
"Who of the Carthaginians was superior to Hannibal in wisdom, and valour, and actual achievements?",
"a man who single-handed fought for so many years for empire and for glory with such numbers of our generals.",
"His own fellow-citizens banished him from the city; but we see that he, though our enemy, is celebrated in the writings and recollection of our citizens.",
"Let us then imitate our Bruti, our Camilli, and Ahalae, our Decii, our Curius, and Fabricius, and Maximus, our Scipios, our Lentuli, our Aemilii, and countless others, who have given liberty to this republic; all of whom I consider deserving of being ranked among the company and number of the immortal gods.",
"Let us love our country, let us obey the senate, let us consult the interests of the good; let us  disregard present rewards, and fix our eyes on the glory which we shall receive from posterity.",
"Let us think that the most desirable conduct, which is the most upright; let us hope for whatever we choose, but bear whatever befals us; let us consider, lastly, that the bodies of brave men and great citizens are mortal, but that the impulses of the mind and the glory of virtue are everlasting.",
"And let us not, if we see that this opinion is consecrated by the most holy example of the great Hercules, whose body indeed has been burnt, but whose life and virtue are said to have received instant immortality, think any the less that they who by their counsels and labours have either increased the greatness, or defended the safety, or preserved the existence of this great republic, have acquired everlasting glory.",
"But suddenly, O judges, while speaking of the dignity and renown of those valiant and most illustrious citizens, and while I was preparing to say still more on that subject, I have been checked in the onward progress of my speech by the sight of these men.",
"I see Publius Sextius, the defender and upholder and chief maintainer of my safety, and of your authority, and of the cause of the commonwealth, on his trial as a criminal; I see his young son, present here before you, gazing on me with tearful eyes; I see Milo, the vindicator of your liberty, the guardian of my safety, the support and defence of the afflicted republic, the extinguisher of the piratical attempts of our domestic enemies, the repressor of daily bloodshed, the defender alike of the temples of the gods and of the houses of individuals, the bulwark of the senate-house, in mourning apparel, and under a prosecution.",
"I see Publius Lentulus, to whose father I pay my salutations as the protecting deity and parent of my fortune and my name, and of my brother, and of all my hopes and property, in the miserable garb and squalid condition of an impeached man: I see the man who in the course of last year received the robe of manhood by the will of his father, and the purple robe by the deliberate choice of the people, now, in this year, in the same robe seeking to avert by his entreaties the sudden infliction of this most iniquitous decree, supplicating you on  behalf of his most gallant father, and your most illustrious citizen.",
"And these mourning robes of so many and of such illustrious citizens, and these signs of grief, and these tokens of abasement, have all been put on for my single sake; because they defended me, because they grieve for my misfortune and for my grief, because, in compliance with the entreaties of all of you, they restored me to my mourning country, to the senate who demanded me back, and to Italy who entreated my recal.",
"What great wickedness is imputed to me?",
"What great crime did I commit on that day; on that day, I say, when I laid before you the proofs against, and the letters and confessions of those men who were seeking the general destruction; when I obeyed your commands?",
"But, if it be a wicked thing to love one's country, still I have suffered punishment enough; my house has been pulled down, my property has been pillaged; my children have been scattered abroad, my wife has been insulted, my most excellent brother, a man of incredible affection and unheard-of devotion to me, has fallen, with all the emblems of most bitter grief, at the feet of my bitterest enemies; I have been driven from my altars, from my hearth, from my household gods; I have been separated from my friends and torn from my country, which (to say the very least) I had most undoubtedly shielded; I have endured the cruelty of my enemies, the wickedness of faithless men, and the dishonesty of envious ones.",
"If this is not enough, because all this appears to be defaced by my return; it were betterit were far better, I say, for me, O judges, to fall back again into the same misfortune as before, than to bring such calamity on my defenders and preservers.",
"Would it be possible for me to remain in this city after those men have been driven away from it, who alone enabled me again to enjoy this city?",
"I cannot do soit will not be possible for me, O judges,nor shall this boy, who now, by his tears, shows how great his filial affection is, ever behold me in safety if he loses the presence of his father on account of his kindness to me; nor shall he, as often as he sees me, groan, and say that he beholds a man who has been the ruin of himself and of his father.",
"I, in every fortune, whatever may befal me, will cling to you; nor shall  any fortune ever separate me from those men whom you, O judges, behold in mourning apparel for my sake.",
"Nor shall those nations to whom the senate recommended me, and to whom it gave thanks for their treatment of me, ever see this man as an exile on account of his conduct to me, without seeing me as his companion.",
"But the immortal gods, who received me on my arrival in their temples, accompanied by these men and by Publius Lentulus the consul, and the republic itself, than which there is nothing more holy, have entrusted these things, O judges, to your power.",
"You are able by your decision to encourage the minds of all virtuous men, and to check the designs of the wicked; you are able by your decision to avail yourselves of the services of the virtuous citizens, to strengthen me, and to renew the republic.",
"Wherefore, I beseech and entreat you, if you wish for my safety, to save those men by whose instrumentality you have recovered me.",
"This speech arose out of the preceding one.",
"Vatinius was a partisan and creature of Caesar's, and instigated by him to appear as a witness against Sextius on his trial; and Cicero was so indignant at a man of so infamous a character appearing against his friend, that he exposed the whole iniquity of his life by the severity of his examination, and the searching nature of the questions which he put to him.",
"And he says of this speech himself, "The whole of my examination of him consisted of nothing but a reproof of his conduct in his tribuneship; and I spoke with great freedom, and the greatest earnestness and indignation."",
"Vatinius had also, while replying to Cicero's questions, attacked Cicero himself as having been a turncoat, and being now anxious himself to curry favour with Caesar, because he saw that his affairs were becoming more prosperous than they had been, and reminded him of his having not always entertained a favourable opinion of Caesar; and Cicero replied, that he still preferred the condition of Bibulus's consulship to the triumphs and victories of any one whatever.",
"If, O Vatinius, I had chosen to regard merely what the unworthiness of your character deserved, I should have  treated you in a way that would have been very pleasing to these men, and, as your evidence could not, on account of the infamy of your life and the scandal of your private conduct, be possibly considered of the slightest consequence, I should have dismissed you without saying a single word to you.",
"For not one of these men considered it worth my while either to refute you, as if you were an adversary of any importance, or to question you, as if you were a scrupulous witness.",
"But I was, perhaps, a little more intemperate just now than I should have been.",
"For from detestation of you, in which, although, on account of your wicked conduct to me, I ought to go beyond all men, yet I am in fact surpassed by everybody, I was carried away so far, that though I did not despise you at all less than I detest you, still I chose to dismiss you in embarrassment and distress, rather than in contempt.",
"Wherefore, that you may not wonder at my having paid you this compliment of putting questions to you, whom no one thinks worthy of being spoken to or visited, whom no one thinks deserving of a vote, or of the rights of a citizen, or even of the light of life; know that no motive would have induced me to do so, except that of repressing that ferocity of yours, and crushing your audacity, and checking your loquacity by entangling it in the few questions I should put to you.",
"In truth, you ought, O Vatinius, even if you had become suspected by Publius Sextius undeservedly, still to pardon me, if, on the occasion of such great danger to a man who has done me such great services, I had yielded to the consideration of what his necessities required, and what his inclination deserved of me.",
"But you unintentionally showed a few moments ago that you spoke falsely in the evidence which you gave yesterday, when you asserted that you had never had the least conversation with Albinovanus, not only about the prosecution of Sextius, but about anything whatever; and yet you said just now that Titus Claudius had been in communication with you, and had asked your advice with respect to the conduct of the prosecution against Sextius, and that Albinovanus, who you had said before was hardly known to you, had come to your house, and had held a long conversation with you.",
"And lastly, you said that you had given to Albinovanus the written harangues of Publius Sextius, which he had never had any knowledge of, and did not know  where to find, and that they had been read at this trial.",
"And by one of these statements you confessed that the accusers had been instructed and suborned by you; and by the other you confessed your own inconsistency, liable to the double charge of folly and of perjury; when you stated that the man, who you had previously said was an entire stranger to you, had come to your house, and that you had given the documents which he asked for to aid him in his accusation to a man whom you had from the beginning considered a trickster and a prevaricator.",
"You are too impetuous and fierce by nature.",
"You do not think it allowable for a word to escape from any man's mouth which may not fall pleasantly and complimentary on your ears.",
"You came forward in a rage with everybody; which I perceived and comprehended the moment I saw you, before you began to speak, while Gellius, the dry nurse of all seditious men, was giving his evidence before you.",
"For on a sudden you sprang forward like a serpent out of his hole, with eyes starting out of your head, and your neck inflated, and your throat swelling; so that

I defended my old friend, who was, nevertheless, an acquaintance of yours; though in this city an attack on another, such as you are now making, is sometimes found fault with, but the defence of a man never is.",
"But I ask you why I should not defend Caius Cornelius?",
"I ask whether Cornelius has ever passed any law in defiance of the auspices?",
"whether he has despised the Aelian or the Fufian law?",
"when he has offered violence to the consul?",
"whether he has occupied any temple with armed men?",
"whether he has driven away by violence any magistrate who was exercising his veto?",
"whether he has profaned any religious ceremonies?",
"whether he has drained the treasury?",
"whether he has pillaged the republic?",
"These, all these, are actions of yours.",
"No imputation of this sort is cast upon Cornelius.",
"He was said to have read a document.",
"It was urged in his defence, his colleagues giving evidence in support of his cause, that he read it, not for the sake of reading it, but for the sake of examining it more particularly.",
"However, it was quite certain that Cornelius dismissed the council that day, and submitted to the interposition of the veto.",
"But you who are  offended at my defending Cornelius, what cause do you bring to your advocates to uphold, or what countenance have you to show?",
"when you already point out to them in an imperious manner, what a disgrace it will be to them if they defend you, by thinking the defence of Cornelius a matter for accusation and abuse of me.",
"However, Vatinius, remember thisthat a little after the time when I defended him in a way which you say gave great offence to all good men, I was appointed consul in the most honourable manner in which any one has been elected since the memory of man, not only by the exceeding zeal in my behalf of the entire Roman people, but also by the special and extraordinary exertions in my cause of every virtuous man; and that I gained all these honours by living in a modest manner, which you have over and over again said that you hoped to obtain by dealing in the most impudent prophecies.",
"For as regards your having blamed me for my departure, and your having attempted to renew the grief and lamentation of those men to whom that day was most miserable, which, however, was to you most joyful, I will make you this reply,that when you and the other pests of the republic were seeking a pretext to take up arms, and using my name as a cloak for your proceedings to pillage the property of the rich citizens, and to drink the blood of the chief men of the state, and satiate your barbarity and the long-standing hatred which you had cherished against all good men till it had become inveterate, I preferred to break the force of your frenzy and wickedness by yielding to it, rather than by resisting it.",
"Wherefore, I entreat you, O Vatinius, to pardon me for sparing the country which I had saved; and I beg you, if I bear with you who would willingly be a harasser and destroyer of the republic, to bear also with me who have been its preserver and its guardian.",
"Do you find fault with that man for having departed from the city, who, as you see, was recalled by the regret of all the citizens, and by the grief of the republic herself?",
"Oh, but you say that men were anxious for my return, not for my sake, but for the sake of the republic.",
"As if any man  who had mixed himself up in the affairs of the state in a proper spirit, could think anything more desirable for him than to be beloved by his fellow-citizens for the sake of the republic.",
"Forsooth, my nature, I suppose, is a harsh one, I am difficult of access, my countenance is forbidding, my answers to men are arrogant, my way of life insolent.",
"No one ever sought the aid of my humanity,no one was ever anxious for my intimacy, for my advice, or my aid; for mine, out of regret for whom (to say the least of it) the forum was sad, the senate-house silent, and all studies of virtuous and liberal sciences voiceless and lifeless.",
"However, I will allow that nothing was done for my sake.",
"Let us admit that all those resolutions of the senate, and commands of the people, and decrees of all Italy, and of all companies, and of all colleges and guilds, concerning me were passed for the sake of the republic.",
"What then, O man most ignorant of the character of solid glory and real dignity, could possibly happen better for me?",
"What could be more desirable as regards the immortality of my glory, and the everlasting recollection of my name, than for all my fellow-citizens to be of this opinion,that the safety of the state was indissolubly bound up with my individual safety?",
"But I will send you back the arrow which you aimed at me.",
"For as you said that I was dear to the senate and people of Rome, not so much for my own sake as for that of the republic, so I say that you, although you are a man of scandalous character, disgraced by every sort of foulness and infamy, still are detested by the city, not so much on your own account, as for the sake of the republic.",
"And, that I may at length come to speak of you, this shall be the last thing which I will say of myself.",
"What any one of us may say of himself, that is not the question.",
"Let good men judge; that is the consideration of the greatest importance and weight.",
"There are two times at which the decisions of our fellow-citizens about us are looked for with anxiety,one when our honours, and the other when our safety is at stake.",
"Honours have been given to few men with such good-will on the part of the Roman people as I have experienced.",
"No one has ever been restored to safety with such extraordinary zeal on the part of all the citizens as I have.",
"But what men think of you we have already had  experience when you were a candidate for honour; and now that your safety is at stake, we are in expectation of what we shall see.",
"However, not to compare myself with these the leading men of the state, who are here to give their countenance to Publius Sextius by their presence, but merely to compare myself to one, the most impudent and vilest of men, I will just ask you, O Vatinius,you the most arrogant of all men, and also the most hostile to me,whether you think it was better and more desirable for this state, for this republic, for this city, for these temples, and for the treasury, and for the senate-house, and for these men whom you see around us, and their property, fortunes, and children,whether you think it was better and more desirable for all the rest of the citizens, and for the temples of the gods, and for the auspices, and for the religious rites and observances of the city, that I should have been born as a citizen in this city, or that you should?",
"When you have answered me this question, either so impudently that men will hardly be able to keep their hands off you, or in so melancholy a manner as to burst that inflated neck and throat of yours; after that, reply to me from memory to these questions which I am going to put to you.",
"And I will allow that dark period of your early youth to remain in obscurity.",
"You may with impunity, as far as I am concerned, have broken through walls in your youth, and plundered your neighbours, and beaten your mother.",
"Your infamous character has this advantage, that the baseness of your youth is concealed by your obscurity and vileness.",
"You stood for the quaestorship with Publius Sextius; while he was talking of nothing but the object which he had in view at the moment, and you were constantly saying that you were thinking of obtaining a second consulship.",
"I ask you this.",
"Do you recollect, when Publius Sextius was unanimously elected quaestor, that you then were named as the last quaestor, against the will of every one, not owing to the kindness which the people felt for you, but only to that of the consul?",
"In that magistracy, when the province of Ostia, down by the water's edge, had fallen to your lot, raising a great outcry at the time, were you not sent by me, as I was consul, to Puteoli, to prevent gold and silver being exported from thence?",
"While occupied in the discharge of that duty, do  you remember that, as you acted as if you supposed that you had been sent, not as a guardian to take care and keep the wealth at home, but as a carrier to distribute it, and as you in a most robber-like manner were examining into every one's house, and store, and ship, and harassing men occupied in business and in trade with most iniquitous law proceedings, frightening merchants as they disembarked from their ships, and delaying them as they were embarking,do you recollect, I say, that violent hands were laid on you in Puteoli while you were present among the body of the Roman settlers?",
"and that the complaints of the people of Puteoli were brought before me as consul?",
"Do you recollect that after your quaestorship you went as lieutenant into the further Spain, Caius Cosconius being the proconsul?",
"Do you recollect, too, that, though that journey into Spain is usually made by land, or if any one chooses to go by sea, there is a regular route by which they sail, you came into Sardinia, and from thence into Africa?",
"Were you not in the kingdom of Hiempsal,a proceeding on your part which was perfectly illegal without a decree of the senate to authorize it?",
"Were you not in the kingdom of Mastanesosus?",
"Did you not come to the strait by way of Mauritania?",
"and did you ever hear of any lieutenant of any part of Spain before you who went to that province by that route?",
"You were made tribune of the people; (for why need I put questions to you about the iniquities and most sordid robberies which you committed in Spain?)",
"I ask of you first, in a general manner, what description of dishonesty and wickedness did you omit to practise in your discharge of that office?",
"And I now give you this warning,not to mix up your own infamy with the high character of most eminent men.",
"I, in whatever questions I put to you, will question you yourself only, and I will drag you forth not from the dignity of a great man, which you affect, but from your own obscurity and darkness.",
"And all my weapons shall be directed at you in such a manner, that no one else shall be wounded (to use an expression of your own) through your side; my arrows shall stick in your lungs and in your entrails.",
"And since the beginnings of all great things are  derived from the gods, I wish you to answer me,you, who are accustomed to call yourself a Pythagorean, and to put forth the name of a most learned man as a screen to hide your own savage and barbarian habits,what depravity of intellect possessed you, what excessive frenzy seized on you, and made you, when you had begun your unheard-of and impious sacrifices, accustomed as you are to seek to evoke the spirits of the shades below, and to appease the Di Manes with the entrails of murdered boys, despise the auspices under which this city was founded, by which the whole of this republic and empire is kept together, and, at the very beginning of your tribuneship, give notice to the senate that the responses of the augurs and the arrogance of that college should be no obstacle to your proceedings?",
"Next to that, I ask you whether you kept your promise in that particular?",
"Did the fact of your knowing that on that day the heavens had been observed, delay, or not delay your summoning the council, and proposing your intended law?",
"And since this is the one thing which you say belongs to you in common with Caesar, I will separate you from him, not only for the sake of the republic, but also for the sake of Caesar, lest any stain from your extraordinary infamy should seem to attach itself to his dignity.",
"First of all, I ask you whether you trust your case to the senate, as Caesar does?",
"Next, what sort of authority that man has who defends himself by the conduct of another and not by his own?",
"Next, (for my real sentiments will at times burst forth, and I cannot help saying without circumlocution what I feel,) even if Caesar had been rather violent in any particular, if the importance of the contest, and anxiety for glory, and his eminent courage, and his admirable nobility of character had carried him away at all, which would have been endurable in that great man, and would have deserved to be obliterated from our minds by the mighty exploits which he has subsequently performed, will you, you wretch, assume the same privilege to yourself, and is the voice of Vatinius, the thief and sacrilegious man, to be heard, demanding that the same indulgence is to be allowed to him that is allowed to Caesar?",
"For this is what I ask of you.",
"You were a tribune of the people.",
"Separate yourself from the consul.",
"You had nine gallant men for your colleagues.",
"Of these there were three whom you knew to be  every day observing the heavens, whom you used to laugh at, whom you used to call private individuals, of whom you see two now sitting here in their robes of office; (you know that you sold the official robe of an aedile which you had had made for yourself to no purpose;) and the third, you are aware, after that tribuneship, in which you oppressed and ill-treated him, gained the consular authority, though a very young man.",
"There were six others; of whom some openly adopted your opinion, and some held a sort of middle course.",
"All had laws which they wished to propose; and among them my own intimate friend Caius Cosconius, one of our judges, had several, some even drawn up by my advice; a man who makes you ready to burst with envy when you see him invested with the rank of aedile.",
"I wish you to reply to me.",
"Did any one of the whole college venture to bring forward any law, except you alone?",
"And how did you become possessed of so much audacity, how did you dare to act with so much violence, as aloneyou, a man raised out of the mud, beyond all comparison the lowest of all men in every respectto think that a proper subject for your contempt, and scorn, and derision, which all your nine colleagues thought deserving of their fear and awe?",
"Have you ever known of any one tribune of the people, since the foundation of the city, having transacted business with the people when it was known that any magistrate was observing the heavens?",
"I wish you also to answer me, as, while you were tribune of the people, the Aelian and Fufian laws still existed in the republic; laws which have repeatedly checked and repressed the frenzy of the tribunes; in contravention of which no one has ever dared to act except you; (though those same laws the year after, when two men were sitting in the temple, whom I will not call consuls, but betrayers of this state, and pestilences, were destroyed at the same time with the auspices, and the power of intercession, and all public law:) Did you ever hesitate to transact business with the people, and to convene the assembly in defiance of these laws?",
"Have you ever heard of any one out of all the tribunes of the people that ever existed, however seditious they may have been, being so audacious as to summon an assembly in defiance of the Aelian and Fufian laws?",
"I ask you this, also, whether you endeavoured,  whether you wished, whether, in short, you intended, (for these all amount to the same thing, so that, if it ever only occurred to your mind, there is no one who would not think you worthy of the greatest severity of punishment,)I ask you, I say, whether you ever intended in the course of that intolerable (I will not say reign of yours, for that is a word which you would like me to use, but) piratical power, to be made augur in the room of Quintus Metellus?",
"so that whoever beheld you might feel a two-fold grief and misery, both from his regret for a most illustrious and most gallant citizen, and from the honour of a most worthless and infamous one.",
"I ask you, did you think, I will not say, that the republic had been so undermined while you were tribune, or that the constitution had been so much battered and shaken, but that this city had been so entirely stormed and overthrown, that we could endure Vatinius for an augur?",
"Here also I ask, if you had been made augur, as you were anxious to be, the bare idea of which on your part caused us, who hated you, a pain which we could hardly endure, while they who were your intimate friends could scarcely forbear laughing at it; still I ask, I say, if in addition to the other wounds under which you believed the republic to be sinking, you had added the deadly and fatal blow of your augurship, would you have decreed that which every augur ever since the time of Romulus has invariably decreed, that when Jupiter was sending forth his lightning it was impious to transact business with the people; or, because you had constantly done so, would you as augur have put an end to the system of taking auspices altogether?",
"And, not to waste any more words on your augurship, (and I speak of it all against my will, as I do not wish to recollect the ruin of the republic; for, indeed, you yourself never thought that you would be augur as long as not only the majesty of these men, but as long as that city itself remained standing,)still, to pass over your dreams, I will come to your acts of wickedness.",
"I wish you to answer me.",
"When you were leading Marcus Bibulus, the consul,I will not call him a man of the justest sentiments with respect to the republic, lest so powerful a man as you, who disagreed with him, should be offended with me; but I will call him a man who certainly never took any violent steps, who never performed  any act of hostility towards you in the republic, but who only felt in his heart a great disapproval of your actions;when, I say, you were leading him, the consul, to prison, and when your colleagues sitting at the Valerian table ordered him to be released, did you or did you not make a bridge in front of the rostra, by joining the stages together, along which bridge, a consul of the Roman people, a man of the greatest moderation and wisdom, removed from all assistance, cut off from all his friends, was to be led by the inflamed violence of profligate men, a most shameful and miserable spectacle, not only to prison, but to execution and to death?",
"I ask whether there was ever any one before your time so wicked as to do such a thing as that?",
"So that we may know whether you are an imitator of old crimes or an inventor of new ones.",
"And when you, by counsels and atrocities of this sort, carried on under the name of Caius Caesar, a most merciful and excellent man, but in reality by your own wickedness and audacity, had driven Marcus Bibulus from the forum, and the senate-house, and the temples, and from all public places, and had compelled him to shut himself up in his own house; and when the life of the consul was only saved, not by the majesty of the empire, or by the sanctity of the laws, but only by the protection which his own doors and walls afforded him; did you not send a lictor to drag Marcus Bibulus from his house by force, in order that, though even in the case of private individuals the sanctity of their house is always observed, while you were tribune of the people even his own house should not be a safe refuge for the consul?",
"Answer me at the same time, you who call us tyrants who are agreed together as to our views for the general safety, were not you a tribune of the people, but in reality an intolerable tyrant raised of some obscure mud and darkness?",
"and did not you attempt in the first instance to overturn the republic, which was originally founded in obedience to auspices, by the destruction of those same auspices; and after that, have not you been the only man to trample under foot and disregard those most holy laws,I mean the Aelian and Fufian laws,which subsisted through the furious times of the Gracchi, and through all the audacity of Saturninus,which  survived unhurt the rabble of Drusus, and the contests of Sulpicius, and the massacres of Cinna, and even the battles and bloodshed of Sylla?",
"Did you not threaten the consul with death, and blockade him when he had shut himself up in his house, and attempt even to drag him out of his house?",
"And you, who by means of that magistracy emerged out of actual beggary, and who now even alarm us by your riches, were you not so inhuman as to endeavour, by means of your proposed law, to get rid of and destroy the chosen men and chief leaders of the state?",
"When you had produced in the assembly Lucius Vettius, who had confessed in the senate that he had been armed with the intention of putting Cnaeus Pompeius, that great and illustrious citizen, to death with his own hands; when you had produced him as a witness in the rostra, and placed him in that temple and place consecrated by the auspices; (in that place in which other tribunes of the people have been in the habit of bringing forward the chief men of the state, in order to sanction their authority by their presence, there you wished Vettius the informer to employ his tongue and voice in support of your wickedness and ambitious designs:)did not Lucius Vettius say, in that assembly which you had convened, when questioned by you, that he had had those men for the originators and encouragers of, and accomplices in that wicked conduct, whom if the city had been deprived of, (and that was your real object at that time,) it could not have continued to stand?",
"You had endeavoured to murder Marcus Bibulus, as you were not contented with shutting him up in his house; you had stripped him of his consulship, you were anxious to  deprive him of his country.",
"You wished also to murder Lucius Lucullus, whose exploits you envied above measure, because, I suppose, you from your boyhood had had an eye yourself to the glory of a general; and Caius Curio, the unceasing enemy of all wicked men, the leader of the public council, a man of the greatest freedom in maintaining the common liberties of the citizens, with his son, the chief of the youth of Rome, and who had already shown more devotion to the cause of the republic than could have been expected from his age; and Lucius Domitius, whose dignity and respectability of character, I suppose, blinded the eyes of Vatinius, and whom you hated at the moment on account of your common hatred of all virtuous men, and whom you had long feared with reference to the future, on account of the hopes which all men had conceived, and indeed do still entertain of him; and Lucius Lentulusthis man who is one of our judges nowthe priest of Mars, because he was at that time a competitor of your dear friend Gabinius: all these you wished to crush by means of the information of this same Vettius.",
"But if Lentulus had then defeated that disgrace and pest of the republic, which he was prevented from doing by your wickedness, the republic would not have been defeated; moreover, you wished by means of the same information and the same accusation to involve his son in his father's ruin.",
"You comprehended in the same information of Vettius, and in the same body of criminals, Lucius Paullus, who was at the time quaestor in Macedonia.",
"How good a citizen!",
"how great a man!",
"who had already banished by his laws two impious traitors to their country, domestic enemies; a man born for the salvation of the republic.",
"Why should I complain of your conduct to myself?",
"when I ought rather to return you thanks, for having thought me deserving of not being separated from the number of gallant and virtuous citizens.",
"But how was it that you were so insane, aswhen Vettius had now summed up his oration just as you pleased, and had uttered his calumnies against all the lights of the city, and had descended from the rostrato call him back on a sudden, and converse with him in the sight of the  Roman people?",
"and then to ask him whether he could not give the name of any one else?",
"Were you not pressing upon him to name Caius Piso, my son-in-law; who, at a time when there was a great abundance of virtuous young men, still has left no one behind him of equal temperance, and virtue, and piety to himself?",
"and also Marcus Laterensis, a man who devotes all his days and nights to thinking of glory and of the republic?",
"Did not you, O you most profligate and abandoned enemy, propose an investigation into the conduct of so many honourable and excellent men, and at the same time most honourable rewards for your informer Vettius?",
"and afterwards, when this conduct of yours was condemned, not merely by the secret feelings of every one, but by their open reproaches, did you not strangle that very man Vettius in prison, in order that there might be no evidence of your having procured his information by bribery, and that no investigation of that guilt might be instituted so as to affect you yourself?",
"And since you are constantly repeating that you proposed a law to allow each party to reject judges alternately, in order that every one may see that you could not contrive even to do right without committing some crime or other, I ask you whether, after a just law had been proposed at the beginning of your magistracy, and after you had also proposed several others, you were waiting till Caius Antonius was prosecuted before Cnaeus Lentulus Clodianus?",
"And after a prosecution was instituted against him, did you not immediately pass a law against him, "Whoever was prosecuted after the proposal of your law," in order that a man of consular rankunhappy man!might be deprived by just that moment of time, of the benefit and equitable provisions of your law?",
"You will say that there was great intimacy between you and Quintus Maximus.",
"An admirable defence of your guilt!",
"No doubt it is the greatest praise of Maximus, that, after he had adopted the quarrel against Caius Antonius, and undertaken the prosecution, and after a president of the court and a bench of judges had been selected, he was unwilling to allow his adversary a power of striking off judges which would have been too favourable for him.",
"Quintus Maximus did nothing inconsistent either with his  own virtue, or with the precedents of those most illustrious men, the Paulli, the Maximi, and Africani; whose renown we not only hope will be renewed by this man's virtue, but we actually see that it is so.",
"It is your dishonesty, your guilt, your wickedness, that, when you had proposed a law under a pretence of mercy, you put it off till a time when it might serve a purpose of cruelty.",
"And now, indeed, Caius Antonius consoles himself under his misery with this one fact, that he had rather be at a distance to hear that the images of his father and his brother, and that his brother's daughter, are placed, not in the house of their family, but in prison, than be at hand to see it.",
"And since you so despise the property of others, and boast in a most intolerable manner of your own riches, I desire you to answer me, whether you, while tribune of the people, made any treaties with foreign states, or kings, or tetrarchs?",
"whether you got any money out of the treasury by your laws?",
"whether you did not at that time deprive people of the most valuable part of their privileges?",
"whether it was Caesar or the farmers of the revenue that you were robbing?",
"And as this is the case, I ask you whether, having been a most miserably poor man, you did not become an exceedingly rich one that very year in which a most stringent law was passed about extortion and peculation?",
"So that all men may see that you trampled not only on the acts of us whom you call tyrants, but even on the laws of your own most intimate friend; before whom you are in the habit of employing hard words against us, who are very friendly to him, while you abuse him in the most insulting manner every time that you say that he is in the least degree connected with you.",
"Yet I forgive Atratinus, a most refined and what’s more a pleasant young man closely connected by my friendship, who has the excuse of either piety or obligation or even his age.",
"If he has wished to accuse, I attribute it to his piety, if he was ordered, to his obligation, if he hoped for something, I allotted to his childhood.",
"The others must not only in no way be pardoned, but they also must be fiercely resisted.",
"And indeed, gentlemen of the jury, it seems to me the most fitting way to launch the defense of the young Marcus Caelius is first to respond to the things his accusers have said to disgrace him and strip and rob him of his good name.",
"The issue of his father has been raised in a variety of ways, because people said either the father himself did not live in sufficient style or the son did not accord him sufficient respect.",
"As for his position, to those who know him and are older, Marcus Caelius easily makes answer himself without uttering a word and even without any defense of mine.",
"As for those, however, to whom he is not so well known because, owing to his advanced years, he has for a long time associated with us less, both in the forum and in private, they may be sure of this: whatever prestige can attach to a Roman knight - and that can certainly be very great - it has always been regarded as a strong feature in Marcus Caelius, and it is so regarded today, not only by those close to him but also by all those who for some reason have been able to come to know him.",
"But being the son of a Roman knight should not have been presented as grounds for a charge by the accusers, before either these jurors or me as the defending counsel.",
"As for what you said about filial respect, it is certainly for us to form an opinion about that.",
"But it is definitely up to the parent to make a considered judgment.",
"You shall hear our opinion from witnesses under oath.",
"But the parents' feelings are clear from the mother's tears and unbelievable sadness, the father's mourning attire and this grief and sorrow you see before you.",
"As for your objection that the young man was disapproved of by his fellow townsmen, the Praetuttians never paid higher honors to anyone while he was with them than to Marcus Caelius while he was not: even while he was absent, they enlisted him in the most distinguished body in the town.",
"Without his asking they conferred on him honors which they refused to many who did so ask.",
"In the same way they have now sent eminent fellow-senators of mine and Roman knights to attend this trial and speak his praises in the weightiest and most eloquent terms.",
"I believe I have laid the foundations of my defence.",
"If it rests on the judgment of his peers, it is rock solid.",
"If this young man were displeasing not only to such a one as his father but also to a community so outstanding and important, you would consider him of insufficient merit.",
"For my part, to turn to my own case, it is from springs such as these that my life has flowed into world repute.",
"These exertions of mine at the bar and the conduct of my career have achieved somewhat wider public recognition because of the commendation and support of my peers.",
"As for the objections you have raised concerning my client's morals, as for all the fuss made by his accusers, not through criminal charges but through backbiting and slander, Marcus Caelius will never feel so bitterly about that as to regret that he was born not ugly.",
"Those slanders are spread around against all who as young men have been marked by an attractive figure and distinguished appearance.",
"But it is one thing to abuse, another to bring an accusation.",
"Accusation needs a criminal charge, so as to define a situation, mark a man, prove by argument and confirm with testimony.",
"But abuse has no purpose but to insult.",
"If this is marked by a strain of viciousness, then it is termed bad-mouthing, but if there is a measure of wit, then it passes for satire.",
"I was surprised and upset that this part of the prosecution was given to Atratinus in particular: it did not become him, his age did not call for it, and, as you could discern, the excellent young man's sense of propriety made him uncomfortable with engaging in a plea of this sort.",
"I could wish that one of the more seasoned among you had undertaken the role of slanderer: I should be considerably less inhibited, more forceful and more my usual self in rebutting the latitude you have granted to slander.",
"I shall deal more gently with you, Atratinus: your sense of propriety restrains my language, and I am obliged to keep unspoilt the service I have rendered you and your father.",
"I want, however, to give you the following warning so that everyone may form an accurate view of you: first, keep as far away from verbal licence as you are from baseness in action; next, say nothing against another which would cause you to blush when fabricated against yourself in return.",
"That path lies open to all the world.",
"Who is there who cannot abuse as viciously as he likes one of your years and personal grace?",
"Even if there are no grounds for suspicion, he can make his slanders sound quite plausible.",
"But the blame for that role of yours rests with those who wanted you to play it.",
"The credit rests with your sense of propriety because we saw you said those things unwillingly, and with your talent because you spoke with elegance and polish."
