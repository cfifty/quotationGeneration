CICERO LM Bigram Quotations: 
WHAT THIS TELLS US: Much worse than the trigram

take from a habit of criminal .

i liken slavery to virtue as necessary as clemency and the purest and the most becomes .

honor is for praise , as the crown of those contracted by muscle , that we forget our own manner and copy .

live as the false pretences , conceit acquired by the treasury and the most sacred excellences and whatever he possesses , plan carefully .

nothing more humbly we may be so god we may be made less justice .

nothing more obscure than those contracted by baldness .

the names of the best things are immortal , whether in itself .

liberty consists in body , our pleasures are instructed by study return again .

love of great charm of the false pretences , that the most becomes him .

the more hated and vanishes and live in a soul , that the doubling of friendship improves happiness and men are infinite money .

justice consists in the set and the needful duties of wisdom .

every man that i liken slavery to virtue as one commonwealth of habit .

in a lasting teacher of character , average minds an unjust peace unharmed .
