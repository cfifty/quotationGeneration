1. Quantatively fill out the surveys.  20 or so people to fill each one out.  The more the better.
	- done tonight 
2. Report ~ 10 - 15 pages
	- certain sections should be filled in now...
3. Presentation ~ 10 minutes
4. Thesarus replacement:
	a. PRE TRAIN: ata set => if there's a strong thesesarus score between two words, then keep the sentence and add a new sentence to the dataset with that replacement.
	b. POST SENTENCE GENERATION: given a sentence generated by our model, make these substitutions.
	Libraries: 
		a. given a word, return similar words "synonyms"
			happy -> joyous, cheerful
			I am happy today -> [I am happy today, I am joyous today, I am joyous now, I am cheerful today, I am cheerful now, I am happy now]
			- metric to determine similarity between two words (Library?) sim(joyous,happy) = 0.95, sim(jhappy,cheeful) = 0.80
		b. do this with all adjectives and maybe all nouns....



For the next 4 hours:
Chris will:
	1. Create an outline for the 10-15 page report, by adding headers, and overll layout
	2. I will have a final model for the RNN model, trained, and predicting words with our data
	3. Update Github Repository and ReadME to include relevant/appropriate links


Jinny will:
	1. Finalize surveys and distribute to 20 people
	2. EC2 instance if necessary/requested by Chris
	3. Find an appropriate library for Thesarus Replacement: given a word -> output a list of similar words
	4. Start writing the script to do Thesarus Replacement

Decide when/where we can meet tonight to work on this.
