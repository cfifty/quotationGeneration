"Of Xenocrates, one of the noblest of philosophers, it is said, that when he was asked what his disciples learnt of him, he replied "to do that of their own choice, which the laws enjoined them to do," therefore the citizen who obliges every one by the authority and fear of the law to do that, which philosophers by reasoning, with difficulty persuade a few to do, is to be preferred to those learned men who only dispute about these things.",
"For which of their orations, however exquisite, can be compared in value to a well constituted state, to public right and to morals.",
"Truly as great and powerful cities, as Ennius says, are as I think, to be preferred to villages and castles; so those who stand pre-eminent in those cities, in authority and counsel, are to be esteemed far before those in wisdom, who are altogether ignorant of the conduct of public affairs.",
"And since we are chiefly urged by a desire to increase the possessions of the human race, and seek by our counsels and labors, to surround the life of man with gratification and security, and are incited by the instincts of nature to these enjoyments; let us hold the course which was always that of the best men: nor attend to those signals which speculative philosophers make from their retirement, to allure back those who are already far advanced.",
"Against these reasons so certain and so clear, it is urged by those who are opposed to us: first, the labour to be undergone in preserving the public welfare; a slight impediment to the zealous and industrious, not alone in matters of such high import, but in inferior things: whether in studies or in official stations; and to be despised even in affairs of business.",
"To this they add the dangers to which life is exposed, and the dread of death, which brave men scorn; being wont to view it as more wretched to waste away by infirmity and old age, than to seize an occasion to devote that life to the advantage of their country, which one day must be rendered to nature.",
"It is here however they deem themselves most successful and eloquent, when they bring forward the calamities of eminent men, and the injuries heaped upon them by their ungrateful countrymen.",
"Here come the instances in Grecian history.",
"Miltiades, the conqueror and subduer of the Persians, with those wounds yet streaming, which he received in front, in the height of victory: preserved from the weapons of the enemy, to waste away his life in the chains of his countrymen.",
"And Themistocles proscribed and driven from the country he had freed, flying, not to the harbors of that Greece he had preserved, but to the barbarous shores he had harassed.",
"Nor indeed are instances wanting among the Athenians of levity and cruelty towards great numbers of their citizens; instances which springing up repeatedly among them, are said also to have abounded too conspicuously in our city.",
"For either the exile of Camillus, the misfortune of Ahala, the ill will towards Nasica, or the expulsion of Lenas, or the condemnation of Opimus is remembered: or the flight of Metellus, the sad overthrow of C. Marius, the cutting off of the most eminent citizens, or the destruction of many of them, which soon after followed.",
"Nor indeed is my name forgotten.",
"And I judge that deeming themselves to owe both life and ease to my peril and counsel, they have a more deep and tender remembrance of me.",
"At the expiration of my consulship, when in the assembly of the Roman people, I swore that the republic had been saved by my exertions, which they confirmed by universal acclamation, I was requited for the cares and vexations of every injury.",
"Albeit my reverses had more honor than pain attached to them, and less disquietude than glory.",
"Greater was my pleasure at receiving the approbation of good men, than my regret at observing the satisfaction of the bad.",
"But had it happened otherwise, as I said, what complaint could I make?",
"Nothing unforeseen could have occurred, nor more grievous than I might have expected for so many of my deeds.",
"For I was one who could well have gathered greater fruits from ease than others, on account of the agreeable variety of the studies I had pursued from my childhood; and if any disaster had overtaken the republic, I need not have sustained a greater share of it, but have divided it equally with the rest.",
"I hesitated not to oppose myself to those stormy tempests, and almost raging waves, for the sake of preserving my fellow citizens, and of accomplishing at my own risk the common safety of all.",
"For our country has not produced us, or educated us under a law, that she is entitled to no support on our part, lending herself as it were to our convenience only; furnishing a secure refuge, and a tranquil and peaceful asylum to our indolence: but rather holds as pledges to her, to be employed for her benefit, the many and great faculties of our mind, genius, and reason; and only permits us to appropriate to our private purposes, that portion of them, of which she stands in no need.",
"The pretenses which are urged for the enjoyment of indolence are not to be listened to.",
"As when it is stated that the public affairs are meddled with by men worthy of no confidence, with whom it is disgraceful to associate: yet to contend against whom is a miserable and dangerous effort, especially when the multitude is excited.",
"For which reason a prudent man ought not to take the reins, when he is not able to restrain the mad and untamable violence of the vulgar: or a generous man expose himself to the lashes of contumely in a strife with low and outrageous adversaries: or a wise man hope to withdraw from such a contest without injury.",
"As if there could well be a more just cause for good and firm men, endowed with noble minds, to stand forth in aid of their country, than that they may not be subject to bad men; nor suffer the republic to be lacerated by them, before the desire of saving it may come too late.",
"But who can approve of their exception, that a wise man ought not to take upon him any part of the public affairs, unless an occasion of extraordinary need should drive him to it?",
"as if indeed a greater necessity could ever have happened to any one, than occurred to myself.",
"How could I have been useful then, had I not been consul?",
"and how could I have been consul, had I not pursued that course of life from my youth, which belonging to the equestrian rank, in which I was born, enabled me to attain the first honors of the state?",
"No man therefore can assume at pleasure the ability of aiding in the public service, however urgent the danger may be, unless he stands in that relation to his country, which fits him for the occasion.",
"And it appears to me most marvelous, that in the discourse of learned men, they who declare themselves unable to steer in a calm sea, because they have never been taught, nor have ever studied the subject, talk of taking the helm in the midst of the greatest storms.",
"For these very men openly declare, and pride themselves greatly upon it, that they have never studied or taught the mode of establishing or protecting the public interest; which they think the exclusive province, not of learned and erudite men, but of those who are practiced in these matters.",
"What consistency is there then in promising to aid the republic in times of peril, when they are incapable of the easier task of directing it in the calmest moments?",
"And although, in truth, the philosopher is not wont of his own accord, to consider the details of state affairs, unless called upon by the times to do it, when indeed he will not decline what duty imposes on him; nevertheless, I judge the knowledge of state affairs is least to be neglected by a wise man; that every thing may be familiar to him, for he cannot tell the moment, when it may be necessary for him to avail himself of his knowledge.",
"These things I have somewhat enlarged upon, because the discussion proposed and undertaken by me in this work, was on government: and in order to prevent its being without effect, it was necessary in the first instance, to remove every doubt as to the duty of engaging in the public service.",
"Nevertheless if there are any who are governed by the opinions of philosophers, let them turn their attention for a while, and listen to those who enjoy a proud pre-eminence among learned men, even when they have not borne any charge in the republic; still whom I deem from the extent of their studies, and their writings on government, to have been invested with functions appertaining to the public interest.",
"But those seven, whom the Greeks call wise, I perceive have almost all been greatly engaged in public affairs.",
"For there is no one thing in which human worth is more nearly allied to the power of the gods, than to found new states, or to preserve those already founded.",
"Concerning which matters, since it hath happened to me, to be deemed something worthy of memory in my administration of public affairs, and to possess some talent for unfolding them; not only in practice, but being versed too in the art of speaking and teaching: while of those before me, some were perfect in debate, yet unknown by their deeds; others of respectable parts for business, without the talent of oratory.",
"Still it is not my intention here to bring forward any new system invented by myself, but to repeat a discussion, that took place at a certain period of our history, among our most illustrious and wise men, which was related to me a long time ago in my youth, by P. Rutilius Rufus, when we were at Smyrna together: in the which I think scarce any point was omitted that belongs to the consideration of these great matters.",
"As he spoke this, a boy announced that Laelius was approaching, having already left his house; upon which Scipio having dressed himself, left his chamber, and had made but a few paces in the portico, when he saluted Laelius who was approaching, and those who were with him: Spurius Mummius, to whom he was particularly attached; Fannius, and Quintus Scaevola, sons-in-law of Laelius, highly gifted young men of the quaestorial age.",
"And having welcomed them all, he made another turn on the portico, placing Laelius in the middle; for in their friendship it was a sort of law between them, that Laelius did homage to Scipio as to a god, on account of his glorious pre-eminence in war; while in his turn Scipio, in private life, paid to Laelius all the reverence due to a parent, on account of his superior years.",
"And having chatted a little together in various places, Scipio, who was very much enlivened and gratified with their arrival, was pleased to have them seated in a sunny place in a little meadow, on account of its being the winter season; which as they were about to do, M. Manilius came, a prudent and agreeable person, and very dear to them all; who being cordially saluted by Scipio and the rest, took his seat next to Laelius.",
"They have all hitherto suffered severer punishments than I could have wished for them; but I marvel that you, O Antonius, do not fear the end of those men whose conduct you are imitating.",
"And in others I was less surprised at this.",
"None of those men of former times was a voluntary enemy to me; all of them were attacked by me for the sake of the republic.",
"But you, who have never been injured by me, not even by a word, in order to appear more audacious than Catiline, more frantic than Clodius, have of your own accord attacked me with abuse, and have considered that your alienation from me would be a recommendation of you to impious citizens.",
"What am I to think?",
"that I have been despised?",
"I see nothing either in my life, or in my influence in the city, or in my exploits, or even in the moderate abilities with which I am endowed, which Antonius can despise.",
"Did he think that it was easiest to disparage me in the senate?",
"a body which has borne its testimony in favor of many most illustrious citizens that they governed the republic well, but in favor of me alone, of all men, that I preserved it.",
"Or did he wish to contend with me in a rivalry of eloquence?",
"This, indeed, is an act of generosity; for what could be a more fertile or richer subject for me, than to have to speak in defense of myself, and against Antonius?",
"This, in fact, is the truth.",
"He thought it impossible to prove to the satisfaction of those men who resembled himself, that he was an enemy to his country, if he was not also an enemy to me.",
"And before I make him any reply on the other topics of his speech, I will say a few words; respecting the friendship formerly subsisting between us, which he has accused me of violating,--for that I consider a most serious charge.",
"He has complained that I pleaded once against his interest.",
"Was I not to plead against one with whom I was quite I unconnected, in behalf of an intimate acquaintance, of a dear friend?",
"Was I not to plead against interest acquired not by hopes of virtue, but by the disgrace of youth?",
"Was I not to plead against an injustice which that man procured to be done by the obsequiousness of a most iniquitous interposer of his veto, not by any law regulating the privileges of the praetor?",
"But I imagine that this was mentioned by you, in order that you might recommend yourself to the citizens, if they all recollected that you were the son-in-law of a freedman, and that your children were the grandsons of Quintus Fadius a freedman.",
"But you had entirely devoted yourself to my principles; (for this is what you said;) you had been in the habit of coming to my house.",
"In truth, if you had done so, you would more have consulted your own character and your reputation for chastity.",
"But you did not do so, nor, if you had wished it, would Caius Curio have ever suffered you to do so.",
"You have said, that you retired in my favor from the contest for the augurship.",
"Oh the incredible audacity!",
"oh the monstrous impudence of such an assertion!",
"For, at the time when Cnaeus Pompeius and Quintus Hortensius named me as augur, after I had been wished for as such by the whole college, (for it was not lawful for me to be put in nomination by more than two members of the college,) you were notoriously insolvent, nor did you think it possible for your safety to be secured by any other means than by the destruction of the republic.",
"But was it possible for you to stand for the augurship at a time when Curio was not in Italy?",
"or even at the time when you were elected, could you have got the votes of one single tribe without the aid of Curio?",
"whose intimate friends even were convicted of violence for having been too zealous in your favor.",
"But I availed myself of your friendly assistance.",
"Of what assistance?",
"Although the instance which you cite I have myself at all times openly admitted.",
"I preferred confessing that I was under obligations to you, to letting myself appear to any foolish person not sufficiently grateful.",
"However, what was the kindness that you did me?",
"not killing me at Brundusium?",
"Would you then have slain the man whom the conqueror himself, who conferred on you, as you used to boast, the chief rank among all his robbers, had desired to be safe, and had enjoined to go to Italy?",
"Grant that you could have slain him, is not this, O conscript fathers, such a kindness as is done by banditti, who are contented with being able to boast that they have granted their lives to all those men whose lives they have not taken?",
"and if that were really a kindness, then these who slew that man by whom they themselves had been saved, and whom you yourself are in the habit of styling most illustrious men, would never have acquired such immortal glory.",
"But what sort of kindness is it, to have abstained from committing nefarious wickedness?",
"It is a case in which it ought not to appear so delightful to me not to have been killed by you, as miserable, that it should have been in your power to do such a thing with impunity.",
"However, grant that it was a kindness, since no greater kindness could be received from a robber, still in what point can you call me ungrateful?",
"Ought I not to complain of the ruin of the republic, lest I should appear ungrateful towards you?",
"But in that complaint, mournful indeed and miserable, but still unavoidable for a man of that rank in which the senate and people of Rome have placed me, what did I say that was insulting?",
"that was otherwise than moderate?",
"that was otherwise than friendly?",
"and what instance was it not of moderation to complain of the conduct of Marcus Antonius, and yet to abstain from any abusive expressions?",
"especially when you had scattered abroad all relics of the republic; when everything was on sale at your house by the most infamous traffic; when you confessed that those laws which had never been promulgated, had been passed with reference to you, and by you; when you, being augur, had abolished the auspices; being consul, had taken away the power of interposing the veto; when you were escorted in the most shameful manner by armed guards; when, worn out with drunkenness and debauchery, you were every day performing all sorts of obscenities in that chaste house of yours.",
"But I, as if I had to contend against Marcus Crassus, with whom I have had many severe struggles, and not with a most worthless gladiator, while complaining in dignified language of the state of the republic, did not say one word which could be called personal.",
"Therefore, to-day I will make him understand with what great kindness he was then treated by me.",
"But he also read letters which he said that I had sent to him, like a man devoid of humanity and ignorant of the common usages of life.",
"For who ever, who was even but slightly acquainted with the habits of polite men, produced in an assembly and openly read letters which had been sent to him by a friend, just because some quarrel had arisen between them?",
"Is not this destroying all companionship in life, destroying the means by which absent friends converse together?",
"How many jests are frequently put in letters, which, if they were produced in public, would appear stupid!",
"How many serious opinions, which, for all that, ought not to be published!",
"Let this be a proof of your utter ignorance of courtesy.",
"Now mark, also, his incredible folly.",
"What have you to oppose to me, O you eloquent man, as you seem at least to Mustela Tamisius, and to Tiro Numisius?",
"And while these men are standing at this very time in the sight of the senate with drawn swords, I too will think you an eloquent man if you will show how you would defend them if they were charged with being assassins.",
"However what answer would you make if I were to deny that I ever sent those letters to you?",
"By what evidence could you convict me?",
"by my handwriting?",
"Of handwriting indeed you have a lucrative knowledge.",
"How can you prove it in that manner?",
"for the letters are written by an amanuensis.",
"By this time I envy your teacher, who for all that payment, which I shall mention presently, has taught you to know nothing.",
"For what can be less like, I do not say an orator, but a man, than to reproach an adversary with a thing which if he denies by one single word, he who has reproached him cannot advance one step further?",
"But I do not deny it; and in this very point I convict you not only of inhumanity but also of madness.",
"For what expression is there in those letters which is not full of humanity and service and benevolence?",
"and the whole of your charge amounts to this, that I do not express a bad opinion of you in those letters; that in them I wrote as to a citizen, and as to a virtuous man, not as to a wicked man and a robber.",
"But your letters I will not produce, although I fairly might, now that I am thus challenged by you; letters in which you beg of me that you may be enabled by my consent to procure the recall of some one from exile; and you will not attempt it if I have any objection, and you prevail on me by your entreaties.",
"For why should I put myself in the way of your audacity?",
"when neither the authority of this body, nor the opinion of the Roman people, nor any laws are able to restrain you.",
"However, what was the object of your addressing these entreaties to me, if the man for whom you were entreating was already restored by a law of Caesar's?",
"I suppose the truth was, that he wished it to be done by me as a favor; in which matter there could not be any favor done even by himself, if a law was already passed for the purpose.",
"But as, O conscript fathers, I have many things which I must say both in my own defense and against Marcus Antonius, one thing I ask you, that you will listen to me with kindness while I am speaking for myself; the other I will ensure myself, namely, that you shall listen to me with attention while speaking against him.",
"At the same time also, I beg this of you; that if you have been acquainted with my moderation and modesty throughout my whole life, and especially as a speaker, you will not, when to-day I answer this man in the spirit in which he has attacked me, think that I have forgotten my usual character.",
"I will not treat him as a consul, for he did not treat me as a man of consular rank; and although he in no respect deserves to be considered a consul, whether we regard his way of life, or his principle of governing the republic, or the manner in which he was elected, I am beyond all dispute a man of consular rank.",
"That, therefore, you might understand what sort of a consul he professed to be himself, he reproached me with my consulship;--a consulship which, O conscript fathers, was in name, indeed, mine, but in reality yours.",
"For what did I determine, what did I contrive, what did I do, that was not determined, contrived, or done, by the counsel and authority and in accordance with the sentiments of this order?",
"And have you, O wise man, O man not merely eloquent, dared to find fault with these actions before the very men by whose counsel and wisdom they were performed?",
"But who was ever found before, except Publius Clodius, to find fault with my consulship?",
"And his fate indeed awaits you, as it also awaited Caius Curio; since that is now in your house which was fatal to each of them.",
"Marcus Antonius disapproves of my consulship; but it was approved of by Publius Servilius--to name that man first of the men of consular rank who had died most recently.",
"It was approved of by Quintus Catulus, whose authority will always carry weight in this republic; it was approved of by the two Luculli, by Marcus Crassus, by Quintus Hortensius, by Caius Curio, by Caius Piso, by Marcus Glabrio, by Marcus Lepidus, by Lucius Volcatius, by Caius Figulus, by Decimus Silanus and Lucius Murena, who at that time were the consuls elect; the same consulship also which was approved of by those men of consular rank, was approved of by Marcus Cato; who escaped many evils by departing from this life, and especially the evil of seeing you consul.",
"But, above all, my consulship was approved of by Cnaeus Pompeius, who, when he first saw me, as he was leaving Syria, embracing me and congratulating me, said, that it was owing to my services that he was about to see his country again.",
"But why should I mention individuals?",
"It was approved of by the senate, in a very full house, so completely, that there was no one who did not thank me as if I had been his parent, who did not attribute to me the salvation of his life, of his fortunes, of his children, and of the republic.",
"But, since the republic has been now deprived of those men whom I have named, many and illustrious as they were, let us come to the living, since two of the men of consular rank are still left to us: Lucius Cotta, a man of the greatest genius and the most consummate prudence, proposed a supplication in my honor for those very actions with which you find fault, in the most complimentary language, and those very men of consular rank whom I have named, and the whole senate, adopted his proposal; an honor which has never been paid to any one else in the garb of peace from the foundation of the city to my time.",
"With what eloquence, with what firm wisdom, with what a weight of authority did Lucius Caesar your uncle, pronounce his opinion against the husband of his own sister, your stepfather.",
"But you, when you ought to have taken him as your adviser and tutor in all your designs, and in the whole conduct of your life, preferred being like your stepfather to resembling your uncle.",
"I, who had no connexion with him, acted by his counsels while I was consul.",
"Did you, who were his sister's son, ever once consult him on the affairs of the republic?",
"But who are they whom Antonius does consult?",
"O ye immortal gods, they are men whose birthdays we have still to learn.",
"To-day Antonius is not coming down.",
"Why?",
"He is celebrating the birthday feast at his villa.",
"In whose honor?",
"I will name no one.",
"Suppose it is in honor of some Phormio, or Gnatho, or even Ballio.",
"Oh the abominable profligacy of the man!",
"Oh how intolerable is his impudence, his debauchery, and his lust!",
"Can you, when you have one of the chiefs of the senate, a citizen of singular virtue, so nearly related to you, abstain from ever consulting him on the affairs of the republic, and consult men who have no property whatever of their own, and are draining yours?",
"Yes, your consulship, forsooth, is a salutary one for the state, mine a mischievous one.",
"Have you so entirely lost all shame as well as all chastity, that you could venture to say this in that temple in which I was consulting that senate which formerly in the full enjoyment of its honors presided over the world?",
"And did you place around it abandoned men armed with swords?",
"But you have dared besides (what is there which you would not dare?)",
"to say that the Capitoline Hill, when I was consul, was full of armed slaves.",
"I was offering violence to the senate, I suppose, in order to compel the adoption of those infamous decrees of the senate.",
"O wretched man, whether those things are not known to you, (for you know nothing that is good,) or whether they are, when you dare to speak so shamelessly before such men!",
"For what Roman knight was there, what youth of noble birth except you, what man of any rank or class who recollected that he was a citizen, who was not on the Capitoline Hill while the senate was assembled in this temple?",
"who was there, who did not give in his name?",
"Although there could not be provided checks enough, nor were the books able to contain their names.",
"In truth, when wicked men, being compelled by the revelations of the accomplices, by their own handwriting, and by what I may almost call the voices of their letters, were confessing that they had planned the parricidal destruction of their country, and that they had agreed to burn the city, to massacre the citizens, to devastate Italy, to destroy the republic; who could have existed without being roused to defend the common safety?",
"especially when the senate and people of Rome had a leader then; and if they had one now like he was then, the same fate would befall you which did overtake them.",
"He asserts that the body of his stepfather was not allowed burial by me.",
"But this is an assertion that was never made by Publius Clodius, a man whom, as I was deservedly an enemy of his, I grieve now to see surpassed by you in every sort of vice.",
"But how could it occur to you to recall to our recollection that you had been educated in the house of Publius Lentulus?",
"Were you afraid that we might think that you could have turned out as infamous as you are by the mere force of nature, if your natural qualities had not been strengthened by education?",
"But recollect, I pray you, how that clever man convicted me of being an accomplice in the business.",
"When Caesar was slain, says he, Marcus Brutus immediately lifted up on high his bloody dagger, and called on Cicero by name; and congratulated him on liberty being recovered.",
"Why on me above all men?",
"Because I knew of it beforehand?",
"Consider rather whether this was not his reason for calling on me, that, when he had performed an action very like those which I myself had done, he called me above all men to witness that he had been an imitator of my exploits.",
"But you, O stupidest of all men, do not you perceive, that if it is a crime to have wished that Caesar should be slain--which you accuse me of having wished--it is a crime also to have rejoiced at his death?",
"For what is the difference between a man who has advised an action, and one who has approved of it?",
"or what does it signify whether I wished it to be done, or rejoice that it has been done?",
"Is there any one then, except you yourself and those men who wished him to become a king, who was unwilling that that deed should be done, or who disapproved of it after it was done?",
"All men, therefore, are guilty as far as this goes.",
"In truth, all good men, as far as it depended on them, bore a part in the slaying of Caesar.",
"Some did not know how to contrive it, some had not courage for it, some had no opportunity,--every one had the inclination.",
"However, remark the stupidity of this fellow,--I should rather say, of this brute beast.",
"For thus he spoke:--"Marcus Brutus, whom I name to do him honor, holding aloft his bloody dagger, called upon Cicero, from which it must be understood that he was privy to the action."",
"Am I then called wicked by you because you suspect that I suspected something; and is he who openly displayed his reeking dagger, named by you that you may do him honor?",
"Be it so.",
"Let this stupidity exist in your language: how much greater is it in your actions and opinions!",
"Arrange matters in this way at last, O consul; pronounce the cause of the Bruti, of Caius Cassius, of Cnaeus Domitius, of Caius Trebonius and the rest to be whatever you please to call it: sleep off that intoxication of yours, sleep it off and take breath.",
"Must one apply a torch to you to waken you while you are sleeping over such an important affair?",
"Will you never understand that you have to decide whether those men who performed that action are homicides or assertors of freedom?",
"For just consider a little; and for a moment think of the business like a sober man.",
"I who, as I myself confess, am an intimate friend of those men, and, as you accuse me, an accomplice of theirs, deny that there is any medium between these alternatives.",
"I confess that they, if they be not deliverers of the Roman people and saviours of the republic, are worse than assassins, worse than homicides, worse even than parricides: since it is a more atrocious thing to murder the father of one's country, than one's own father.",
"You wise and considerate man, what do you say to this?",
"If they are parricides, why are they always named by you, both in this assembly and before the Roman people, with a view to do them honor?",
"Why has Marcus Brutus been, on your motion, excused from obedience to the laws, and allowed to be absent.",
"Why were the games of Apollo celebrated with incredible honor to Marcus Brutus?",
"why were provinces given to Brutus and Cassius?",
"why were quaestors assigned to them?",
"why was the number of their lieutenants augmented?",
"And all these measures were owing to you.",
"They are not homicides then.",
"It follows that in your opinion they are deliverers of their country, since there can be no other alternative.",
"What is the matter?",
"Am I embarrassing you?",
"For perhaps you do not quite understand propositions which are stated disjunctively.",
"Still this is the sum total of my conclusion; that since they are acquitted by you of wickedness, they are at the same time pronounced most worthy of the very most honorable rewards.",
"Therefore, I will now proceed again with my oration.",
"I will write to them, if any one by chance should ask whether what you have imputed to me be true, not to deny it to any one.",
"In truth, I am afraid that it must be considered either a not very creditable thing to them, that they should have concealed the fact of my being an accomplice; or else a most discreditable one to me that I was invited to be one, and that I shirked it.",
"For what greater exploit (I call you to witness, O august Jupiter!)",
"was ever achieved not only in this city, but in all the earth?",
"What more glorious action was ever done?",
"What deed was ever more deservedly recommended to the everlasting recollection of men?",
"Do you, then, shut me up with the other leaders in the partnership in this design, as in the Trojan horse?",
"I have no objection; I even thank you for doing so, with whatever intent you do it.",
"For the deed is so great an one, that I cannot compare the unpopularity which you wish to excite against me on account of it, with its real glory.",
"For who can be happier than those men whom you boast of having now expelled and driven from the city?",
"What place is there either so deserted or so uncivilized, as not to seem to greet and to covet the presence of those men wherever they have arrived?",
"What men are so clownish as not, when they have once beheld them, to think that they have reaped the greatest enjoyment that life can give?",
"And what posterity will be ever so forgetful, what literature will ever be found so ungrateful, as not to cherish their glory with undying recollection?",
"Enroll me then, I beg, in the number of those men.",
"But one thing I am afraid you may not approve of.",
"For if I had really been one of their number, I should have not only got rid of the king, but of the kingly power also out of the republic; and if I had been the author of the piece, as it is said, believe me, I should not have been contented with one act, but should have finished the whole play.",
"Although, if it be a crime to have wished that Caesar might be put to death, beware, I pray you, O Antonius, of what must be your own case, as it is notorious that you, when at Narbo, formed a plan of the same sort with Caius Trebonius; and it was on account of your participation in that design that, when Caesar was being killed, we saw you called aside by Trebonius.",
"But I (see how far I am from any horrible inclination towards,) praise you for having once in your life had a righteous intention; I return you thanks for not having revealed the matter; and I excuse you for not having accomplished your purpose.",
"That exploit required a man.",
"And if any one should institute a prosecution against you, and employ that test of old Cassius, "who reaped any advantage from it?"",
"take care, I advise you, lest you suit that description.",
"Although, in truth, that action was, as you used to say, an advantage to every one who was not willing to be a slave, still it was so to you above all men, who are not merely not a slave, but are actually a king; who delivered yourself from an enormous burden of debt at the temple of Ops; who, by your dealings with the account books, there squandered a countless sum of money; who have had such vast treasures brought to you from Caesar's house; at whose own house there is set up a most lucrative manufactory of false memoranda and autographs, and a most iniquitous market of lands, and towns, and exemptions, and revenues.",
"In truth, what measure except the death of Caesar could possibly have been any relief to your indigent and insolvent condition?",
"You appear to be somewhat agitated.",
"Have you any secret fear that you yourself may appear to have had some connexion with that crime?",
"I will release you from all apprehension; no one will ever believe it; it is not like you to deserve well of the republic; the most illustrious men in the republic are the authors of that exploit; I only say that you are glad it was done; I do not accuse you of having done it.",
"I have replied to your heaviest accusations, I must now also reply to the rest of them.",
"However, let us say no more of that war, in which you were too fortunate.",
"I will not reply even with those jests to which you have said that I gave utterance in the camp.",
"That camp was in truth full of anxiety, but although men are in great difficulties, still, provided they are men, they sometimes relax their minds.",
"But the fact that the same man finds fault with my melancholy, and also with my jokes, is a great proof that I was very moderate in each particular.",
"You have said that no inheritances come to me.",
"Would that this accusation of yours were a true one; I should have more of my friends and connexions alive.",
"But how could such a charge ever come into your head?",
"For I have received more than twenty millions of sesterces in inheritances.",
"Although in this particular I admit that you have been more fortunate than I.",
"No one has ever made me his heir except he was a friend of mine, in order that my grief of mind for his loss might be accompanied also with some gain, if it was to be considered as such.",
"But a man whom you never even saw, Lucius Rubrius, of Casinum, made you his heir.",
"And see now how much he loved you, who, though he did not know whether you were white or black, passed over the son of his brother, Quintus Fufius, a most honorable Roman knight, and most attached to him, whom he had on all occasions openly declared his heir, (he never even names him in his will,) and he makes you his heir whom he had never seen, or at all events had never spoken to.",
"I wish you would tell me, if it is not too much trouble, what sort of countenance Lucius Turselius was of; what sort of height; from what municipal town he came; and of what tribe he was a member.",
""I know nothing," you will say, "about him, except what farms he had."",
"Therefore, he, disinheriting his brother, made you his heir.",
"And besides these instances, this man has seized on much other property belonging to men wholly unconnected with him, to the exclusion of the legitimate heirs, as if he himself were the heir.",
"Although the thing that struck me with most astonishment of all was, that you should venture to make mention of inheritances, when you yourself had not received the inheritance of your own father.",
"The tribune of the people was borne along in a chariot, lictors crowned with laurel preceded him; among whom, on an open litter, was carried an actress; whom honorable men, citizens of the different municipalities, coming out from their towns under compulsion to meet him, saluted not by the name by which she was well known on the stage, but by that of Volumnia.",
"A car followed full of pimps; then a lot of debauched companions; and then his mother, utterly neglected, followed the mistress of her profligate son, as if she had been her daughter-in-law.",
"O the disastrous fecundity of that miserable woman!",
"With the marks of such wickedness as this did that fellow stamp every municipality, and prefecture, and colony, and, in short, the whole of Italy.",
"To find fault with the rest of his actions, O conscript fathers, is difficult, and somewhat unsafe.",
"He was occupied in war; he glutted himself with the slaughter of citizens who bore no resemblance to himself.",
"He was fortunate--if at least there can be any good fortune in wickedness.",
"But since we wish to show a regard for the veterans, although the cause of the soldiers is very different from yours; they followed their chief; you went to seek for a leader; still, (that I may not give you any pretense for stirring up odium against me among them,) I will say nothing of the nature of the war.",
"When victorious, you returned with the legions from Thessaly to Brundusium.",
"There you did not put me to death.",
"It was a great kindness!",
"For I confess that you could have done it.",
"Although there was no one of those men who were with you at that time, who did not think that I ought to be spared.",
"For so great is men's affection for their country, that I was sacred even in the eyes of your legions, because they recollected that the country had been saved by me.",
"However, grant that you did give me what you did not take away from me; and that I have my life as a present from you, since it was not taken from me by you; was it possible for me, after all your insults, to regard that kindness of yours as I regarded it at first, especially after you saw that you must hear this reply from me?",
"You came to Brundusium, to the bosom and embraces of your actress.",
"What is the matter?",
"Am I speaking falsely?",
"How miserable is it not to be able to deny a fact which it is disgraceful to confess!",
"If you had no shame before the municipal towns, had you none even before your veteran army?",
"For what soldier was there who did not see her at Brundusium?",
"who was there who did not know that she had come so many days' journey to congratulate you?",
"who was there who did not grieve that he was so late in finding out how worthless a man he had been following?",
"Again you made a tour through Italy, with that same actress for your companion.",
"Cruel and miserable was the way in which you led your soldiers into the towns; shameful was the pillage in every city, of gold and silver, and above all, of wine.",
"And besides all this, while Caesar knew nothing about it, as he was at Alexandria, Antonius, by the kindness of Caesar's friends, was appointed his master of the horse.",
"Then he thought that he could live with Hippia by virtue of his office, and that he might give horses which were the property of the state to Sergius the buffoon.",
"At that time he had selected for himself to live in, not the house which he now dishonors, but that of Marcus Piso.",
"Why need I mention his decrees, his robberies, the possessions of inheritances which were given him, and those too which were seized by him?",
"Want compelled him; he did not know where to turn.",
"That great inheritance from Lucius Rubrius, and that other from Lucius Turselius, had not yet come to him.",
"He had not yet succeeded as an unexpected heir to the place of Cnaeus Pompeius, and of many others who were absent.",
"He was forced to live like a robber, having nothing beyond what he could plunder from others.",
"However, we will say nothing of these things, which are acts of a more hardy sort of villainy.",
"Let us speak rather of his meaner descriptions of worthlessness.",
"You, with those jaws of yours, and those sides of yours, and that strength of body suited to a gladiator, drank such quantities of wine at the marriage of Hippia, that you were forced to vomit the next day in the sight of the Roman people.",
"O action disgraceful not merely to see, but even to hear of!",
"If this had happened to you at supper amid those vast drinking cups of yours, who would not have thought it scandalous?",
"But in an assembly of the Roman people, a man holding a public office, a master of the horse, to whom it would have been disgraceful even to belch, vomiting filled his own bosom and the whole tribunal with fragments of what he had been eating reeking with wine.",
"But he himself confesses this among his other disgraceful acts.",
"Let us proceed to his more splendid offenses.",
"He does not dissemble, O conscript fathers; it is plain that he is agitated; he perspires; he turns pale.",
"Let him do what he pleases, provided he is not sick, and does not behave as he did in the Minucian colonnade.",
"What defense can be made for such beastly behavior?",
"I wish to hear, that I may see the fruit of those high wages of that rhetorician, of that land given in Leontini.",
"Your colleague was sitting in the rostra, clothed in purple robe, on a golden chair, wearing a crown.",
"You mount the steps; you approach his chair; (if you were a priest of Pan, you ought to have recollected that you were consul too;) you display a diadem.",
"There is a groan over the whole forum.",
"Where did the diadem come from?",
"For you had not picked it up when lying on the ground, but you had brought it from home with you, a premeditated and deliberately planned wickedness.",
"You placed the diadem on his head amid the groans of the people; he rejected it amid great applause.",
"You then alone, O wicked man, were found, both to advise the assumption of kingly power, and to wish to have him for your master who was your colleague; and also to try what the Roman people might be able to bear and to endure.",
"Moreover, you even sought to move his pity; you threw yourself at his feet as a suppliant; begging for what?",
"to be a slave?",
"You might beg it for yourself, when you had lived in such a way from the time that you were a boy that you could bear everything, and would find no difficulty in being a slave; but certainly you had no commission from the Roman people to try for such a thing for them.",
"Oh how splendid was that eloquence of yours, when you harangued the people stark naked!",
"What could be more foul than this?",
"more shameful than this?",
"more deserving of every sort of punishment?",
"Are you waiting for me to prick you more?",
"This that I am saying must tear you and bring blood enough if you have any feeling at all.",
"I am afraid that I may be detracting from the glory of some most eminent men.",
"Still my indignation shall find a voice.",
"What can be more scandalous than for that man to live who placed a diadem on a man's head, when every one confesses that that man was deservedly slain who rejected it?",
"And, moreover, he caused it to be recorded in the annals, under the head of Lupercalia, "That Marcus Antonius, the consul, by command of the people, had offered the kingdom to Caius Caesar, perpetual dictator; and that Caesar had refused to accept it."",
"I now am not much surprised at your seeking to disturb the general tranquillity; at your hating not only the city but the light of day; and at your living with a pack of abandoned robbers, disregarding the day, and yet regarding nothing beyond the day.",
"For where can you be safe in peace?",
"What place can there be for you where laws and courts of justice have sway, both of which you, as far as in you lay, destroyed by the substitution of kingly power?",
"Was it for this that Lucius Tarquinius was driven out; that Spurius Cassius, and Spurius Maelius, and Marcus Manlius were slain; that many years afterwards a king might be established at Rome by Marcus Antonius, though the bare idea was impiety?",
"However, let us return to the auspices.",
"In the general opinion this premature canvass of his is not unfavourable to my interests; for the voters generally give as a reason for their refusal that they are under obligations to me.",
"So I hope my prospects are to a certain degree improved by the report getting about that my friends are found to be numerous.",
"My intention was to begin my own canvass just at the very time that Cincius tells me that your servant starts with this letter, namely, in the campus at the time of the tribunician elections on the 17th of July.",
"My fellow candidates, to mention only those who seem certain, are Galba and Antonius and Q. Cornificius.",
"At this I imagine you smiling or sighing.",
"Well, to make you positively smite your forehead, there are people who actually think that Caesonius will stand.",
"I don't think Aquilius will, for he openly disclaims it and has alleged as an excuse his health and his leading position at the bar.",
"Catiline will certainly be a candidate, if you can imagine a jury finding that the sun does not shine at noon.",
"As for Aufidius and Palicanus, I don't think you will expect to hear from me about them.",
"Of the candidates for this year's election Caesar is considered certain.",
"Thermus is looked upon as the rival of Silanus.",
"These latter are so weak both in friends and reputation that it seems pas impossible to bring in Curius over their heads.",
"But no one else thinks so.",
"What seems most to my interests is that Thermus should get in with Caesar.",
"For there is none of those at present canvassing who, if left over to my year, seems likely to be a stronger candidate, from the fact that he is commissioner of the via Flaininia, and when that has been finished, I shall be greatly relieved to have seen him elected consul this election.",
"Such in outline is the position of affairs in regard to candidates up to date.",
"For myself I shall take the greatest pains to carry out all the duties of a candidate, and perhaps, as Gaul seems to have a considerable voting power, as soon as business at Rome has come to a standstill I shall obtain a libera legatio and make an excursion in the course of September to visit Piso, but so as not to be back later than January.",
"When I have ascertained the feelings of the nobility I will write you word.",
"Everything else I hope will go smoothly, at any rate while my competitors are such as are now in town.",
"You must undertake to secure for me the entourage of our friend Pompey, since you are nearer than I.",
"Tell him I shall not be annoyed if he doesn't come to my election.",
"So much for that business.",
"But there is a matter for which I am very anxious that you should forgive me.",
"Your uncle Caecilius having been defrauded of a large sum of money by P. Varius, began an action against his cousin A. Caninius Satyrus for the property which (as he alleged) the latter had received from Varius by a collusive sale.",
"He was joined in this action by the other creditors, among whom were Lucullus and P. Scipio, and the man whom they thought would be official receiver if the property was put up for sale, Lucius Pontius; though it is ridiculous to be talking about a receiver at this stage in the proceedings.",
"Caecilius asked me to appear for him against Satyrus.",
"Now, scarcely a day passes that Satyrus does not call at my house.",
"The chief object of his attentions is L. Domitius, but I am next in his regard.",
"He has been of great service both to myself and to my brother Quintus in our elections.",
"I was very much embarrassed by my intimacy with Satyrus as well as that with Domitius, on whom the success of my election depends more than on anyone else.",
"I pointed out these facts to Caecilius; at the same time I assured him that if the case had been one exclusively between himself and Satyrus, I would have done what he wished.",
"As the matter actually stood, all the creditors being concerned--and that two men of the highest rank, who, without the aid of anyone specially retained by Caecilius, would have no difficulty in maintaining their common cause--it was only fair that he should have consideration both for my private friendship and my present situation.",
"He seemed to take this somewhat less courteously than I could have wished, or than is usual among gentlemen; and from that time forth he has entirely withdrawn from the intimacy with me which was only of a few days  standing.",
"Pray forgive me, and believe that I was prevented by nothing but natural kindness from assailing the reputation of a friend in so vital a point at a time of such very great distress, considering that he had shown me every sort of kindness and attention, But if you incline to the harsher view of my conduct, take it that the interests of my canvass prevented me.",
"Yet, even granting that to be so, I think you should pardon me, "since not for sacred beast or oxhide shield."",
"You see in fact the position I am in, and how necessary I regard it, not only to retain but even to acquire all possible sources of popularity.",
"I hope I have justified myself in your eyes, I am at any rate anxious to have done so.",
"The Hermathena you sent I am delighted with: it has been placed with such charming effect that the whole gymnasium seems arranged specially for it.",
"I am exceedingly obliged to you.",
"I have to inform you that on the day of the election of L. lulius Caesar and C. Marcius Figulus to the consulship, I had an addition to my family in the shape of a baby boy.",
"Terentia doing well.",
"Why such a time without a letter from you?",
"I have already written to you fully about my circumstances.",
"At this present time I am considering whether to undertake the defense of my fellow candidate, Catiline.",
"We have a jury to our minds with full consent of the prosecutor.",
"I hope that if he is acquitted he will be more closely united with me in the conduct of our canvass; but if the result he otherwise I shall bear it with resignation.",
"Your early return is of great importance to me, for there is a very strong idea prevailing that some intimate friends of yours, persons of high rank, will be opposed to my election.",
"To win me their favor I see that I shall want you very much.",
"Wherefore be sure to be in Rome in January, as you have agreed to be.",
"If you and the army are well I shall be glad.",
"From your official despatch I have, in common with everyone else, received the liveliest satisfaction; for you have given us that strong hope of peace, of which, in sole reliance on you, I was assuring everyone.",
"But I must inform you that your old enemies--now posing as your friends--have received a stunning blow by this despatch, and, being disappointed in the high hopes they were entertaining, are thoroughly depressed.",
"Though your private letter to me contained a somewhat slight expression of your affection, yet I can assure you it gave me pleasure: for there is nothing in which I habitually find greater satisfaction than in the consciousness of serving my friend; and if on any occasion I do not meet with an adequate return, I am not at all sorry to have the balance of kindness in my favor.",
"Of this I feel no doubt--even if my extraordinary zeal in your behalf has failed to unite you to me--that the interests of the state will certainly effect a mutual attachment and coalition between us.",
"To let you know, however, what I missed in your letter I will write with the candor which my own disposition and our common friendship demand.",
"I did expect some congratulation in your letter on my achievements, for the sake at once of the ties between us and of the Republic.",
"This I presume to have been omitted by you from a fear of hurting anyone's feelings.",
"But let me tell you that what I did for the salvation of the country is approved by the judgment and testimony of the whole world.",
"You are a much greater man that Africanus, but I am not much inferior to Laelius either; and when you come home you will recognize that I have acted with such prudence and spirit, that you will not now be ashamed of being coupled with me in politics as well as in private friendship.",
"Your letter, in which you inclose copies of his letters, has made me realize that my brother Quintus's feelings have undergone many alternations, and that his opinions and judgments have varied widely from time to time.",
"This has not only caused me all the pain which my extreme affection for both of you was bound to bring, but it has also made me wonder what can have happened to cause my brother Quintus such deep offense, or such an extraordinary change of feeling.",
"And yet I was already aware, as I saw that you also, when you took leave of me, were beginning to suspect, that there was some lurking dissatisfaction, that his feelings were wounded, and that certain unfriendly suspicions had sunk deep into his heart.",
"On trying on several previous occasions, but more eagerly than ever after the allotment of his province, to assuage these feelings, I failed to discover on the one hand that the extent of his offense was so great as your letter indicates; but on the other I did not make as much progress in allaying it as I wished.",
"However, I consoled myself with thinking that there would be no doubt of his seeing you at Dyrrachium, or somewhere in your part of the country: and, if that happened, I felt sure and fully persuaded that everything would be made smooth between you, not only by conversation and mutual explanation, but by the very sight of each other in such an interview.",
"For I need not say in writing to you, who knows it quite well, how kind and sweet-tempered my brother is, as ready to forgive as he is sensitive in taking offense.",
"But it most unfortunately happened that you did not see him anywhere.",
"For the impression he had received from the artifices of others had more weight with him than duty or relationship, or the old affection so long existing between you, which ought to have been the strongest influence of all.",
"And yet, as to where the blame for this misunderstanding resides, I can more easily conceive than write: since I am afraid that, while defending my own relations, I should not spare yours.",
"For I perceive that, though no actual wound was inflicted by members of the family, they yet could at least have cured it.",
"But the root of the mischief in this case, which perhaps extends farther than appears, I shall more conveniently explain to you when we meet.",
"As to the letter he sent to you from Thessalonica, and about the language which you suppose him to have used both at Rome among your friends and on his journey, I don't know how far the matter went, but my whole hope of removing this unpleasantness rests on your kindness.",
"For if you will only make up your mind to believe that the best men are often those whose feelings are most easily irritated and appeased, and that this quickness, so to speak, and sensitiveness of disposition are generally signs of a good heart; and lastly--and this is the main thing--that we must mutually put up with each other's gaucheries (shall I call them?",
"), or faults, or injurious acts, then these misunderstandings will, I hope, be easily smoothed away.",
"I beg you to take this view, for it is the dearest wish of my heart (which is yours as no one else's can be) that there should not be one of my family or friends who does not love you and is not loved by you.",
"That part of your letter was entirely superfluous, in which you mention what opportunities of doing good business in the provinces or the city you let pass at other times as well as in the year of my consulship: for I am thoroughly persuaded of your unselfishness and magnanimity, nor did I ever think that there was any difference between you and me except in our choice of a career.",
"Ambition led me to seek official advancement, while another and perfectly laudable resolution led you to seek an honorable privacy.",
"In the true glory, which is founded on honesty, industry, and piety, I place neither myself nor anyone else above you.",
"In affection towards myself, next to my brother and immediate family, I put you first.",
"For indeed, indeed I have seen and thoroughly appreciated how your anxiety and joy have corresponded with the variations of my fortunes.",
"Often has your congratulation added a charm to praise, and your consolation a welcome antidote to alarm.",
"Nay, at this moment of your absence, it is not only your advice--in which you excel--but the interchange of speech--in which no one gives me so much delight as you do--that I miss most, shall I say in politics, in which circumspection is always incumbent on me, or in my forensic labour, which I formerly sustained with a view to official promotion, and nowadays to maintain my position by securing popularity, or in the mere business of my family?",
"In all these I missed you and our conversations before my brother left Rome, and still more do I miss them since.",
"Finally, neither my work nor rest, neither my business nor leisure, neither my affairs in the forum or at home, public or private, can any longer do without your most consolatory and affectionate counsel and conversation.",
"The modest reserve which characterizes both of us has often prevented my mentioning these facts; but on this occasion it was rendered necessary by that part of your letter in which you expressed a wish to have yourself and your character "put straight" and "cleared" in my eyes.",
"Yet, in the midst of all this unfortunate alienation and anger on his part, there is yet one fortunate circumstance--that your determination of not going to a province was known to me and your other friends, and had been at various times asserted by yourself; so that your not being with him may be attributed to your personal tastes and judgment, not to the quarrel and rupture between you.",
"So those ties which have been broken will be restored, and ours which have been so religiously preserved will retain all their old inviolability.",
"At Rome I find politics in a shaky condition; everything is unsatisfactory and foreboding change.",
"For I have no doubt you have been told that our friends, the equites, are all but alienated from the senate.",
"Their first grievance was the promulgation of a bill on the authority of the senate for the trial of such as had taken bribes for giving a verdict.",
"I happened not to be in the house when that decree was passed, but when I found that the equestrian order was indignant at it, and yet refrained from openly saying so, I remonstrated with the senate, as I thought, in very impressive language, and was very weighty and eloquent considering the unsatisfactory nature of my cause.",
"But here is another piece of almost intolerable coolness on the part of the equites, which I have not only submitted to, but have even put in as good a light as possible!",
"The Companies which had contracted with the censors for Asia complained that in the heat of the competition they had taken the contract at an excessive price; they demanded that the contract should be annulled.",
"I led in their support, or rather, I was second, for it was Crassus who induced them to venture on this demand.",
"The case is scandalous, the demand a disgraceful one, and a confession of rash speculation.",
"Yet there was a very great risk that, if they got no concession, they would be completely alienated from the senate.",
"Here again I came to the rescue more than anyone else, and secured them a full and very friendly house, in which I, on the 1st and 2nd of December, delivered long speeches on the dignity and harmony of the two orders.",
"The business is not yet settled, hut the favorable feeling of the senate has been made manifest: for no one had spoken against it except the consul-designate, Metellus; while our hero Cato had still to speak, the shortness of the day having prevented his turn being reached.",
"Thus I, in the maintenance of my steady policy, preserve to the best of my ability that harmony of the orders which was originally my joiner's work; but since it all now seems in such a crazy condition, I am constructing what I may call a road towards the maintenance of our power, a safe one I hope, which I cannot fully describe to you in a letter, but of which I will nevertheless give you a hint.",
"I cultivate close intimacy with Pompey.",
"I foresee what you will say.",
"I will use all necessary precautions, and I will write another time at greater length about my schemes for managing the Republic.",
"You must know that Lucceius has it in his mind to stand for the consulship at once; for there are said to be only two candidates in prospect.",
"Caesar is thinking of coming to terms with him by the agency of Arrius, and Bibulus also thinks he may effect a coalition with him by means of C. Piso.",
"You smile?",
"This is no laughing matter, believe me.",
"What else shall I write to you?",
"What?",
"I have plenty to say, but must put it off to another time.",
"If you mean to wait till you hear, let me know.",
"For the moment I am satisfied with a modest request, though it is what I desire above everything-- that you should come to Rome as soon as possible.",
"Yes, I do write to you less often than I might, because, though I am always wretched, yet when I write to you or read a letter from you, I am in such floods of tears that I cannot endure it.",
"Oh, that I had clung less to life!",
"I should at least never have known real sorrow, or not much of it, in my life.",
"Yet if fortune has reserved for me any hope of recovering at any time any position again, I was not utterly wrong to do so: if these miseries are to be permanent, I only wish, my dear, to see you as soon as possible and to die in your arms, since neither gods, whom you have worshipped with such pure devotion, nor men, whom I have ever served, have made us any return.",
"I have been thirteen days at Brundisium in the house of M. Laenius Flaccus, a very excellent man, who has despised the risk to his fortunes and civil existence in comparison to keeping me safe, nor has been induced by the penalty of a most iniquitous law to refuse me the rights and good offices of hospitality and friendship.",
"May I sometime have the opportunity of repaying him!",
"Feel gratitude I always shall.",
"I set out from Brundisium on the 29th of April, and intend going through Macedonia to Cyzicus.",
"What a fall!",
"What a disaster!",
"What can I say?",
"Should I ask you to come--a woman of weak health and broken spirit?",
"Should I refrain from asking you?",
"Am I to be without you, then?",
"I think the best course is this: if there is any hope of my restoration, stay to promote it and push the thing on: but if, as I fear, it proves hopeless, pray come to me by any means in your power.",
"Be sure of this, that if I have you I shall not think myself wholly lost.",
"But what is to become of my darling Tullia?",
"You must see to that now: I can think of nothing.",
"But certainly, however things turn out, we must do everything to promote that poor little girl's married happiness and reputation.",
"Again, what is my boy Cicero to do?",
"Let him, at any rate, be ever in my bosom and in my arms.",
"I can't write more.",
"A fit of weeping hinders me.",
"I don't know how you have got on; whether you are left in possession of anything, or have been, as I fear, entirely plundered.",
"Piso, as you say, I hope will always be our friend.",
"As to the manumission of the slaves you need not be uneasy.",
"To begin with, the promise made to yours was that you would treat them according as each severally deserved.",
"So far Orpheus has behaved well, besides him no one very markedly so.",
"With the rest of the slaves the arrangement is that, if my property is forfeited, they should become my freedmen, supposing them to be able to maintain at law that status.",
"But if my property remained in my ownership, they were to continue slaves, with the exception of a very few.",
"But these are trifles.",
"To return to your advice, that I should keep up my courage and not give up hope of recovering my position, I only wish that there were any good grounds for entertaining such a hope.",
"As it is, when, alas!",
"shall I get a letter from you?",
"Who will bring it me?",
"I would have waited for it at Brundisium, but the sailors would not allow it, being unwilling to lose a favorable wind.",
"For the rest, put as dignified a face on the matter as you can, my dear Terentia.",
"Our life is over: we have had our day: it is not any fault of ours that has ruined us, but our virtue.",
"I have made no false step, except in not losing my life when I lost my honors.",
"But since our children preferred my living, let us bear everything else, however intolerable.",
"And yet I, who encourage you, cannot encourage myself.",
"I have sent that faithful fellow Clodius Philhetaerus home, because he was hampered with weakness of the eyes.",
"Sallustius seems likely to outdo everybody in his attentions.",
"Pescennius is exceedingly kind to me; and I have hopes that he will always be attentive to you.",
"Sicca had said that he would accompany me; but he has left Brundisium.",
"Take the greatest care of your health, and believe me that I am more affected by your distress than my own.",
"My dear Terentia, most faithful and best of wives, and my darling little daughter, and that last hope of my race, Cicero, good-bye!",
"Brother!",
"did you really fear that I had been induced by some angry feeling to send slaves to you without a letter?",
"Or even that I did not wish to see you?",
"I to be angry with you!",
"Is it possible for me to be angry with you?",
"Why, one would think that it was you that brought me low!",
"Your enemies, your unpopularity, that miserably ruined me, and not I that unhappily ruined you!",
"The fact is, the much-praised consulate of mine has deprived me of you, of children, country, fortune; from you I should hope it will have taken nothing but myself.",
"Certainly on your side I have experienced nothing but what was honorable and gratifying: on mine you have grief for my fall and fear for your own, regret, mourning, desertion.",
"I not wish to see you?",
"The truth is rather that I was unwilling to be seen by you.",
"For you would not have seen your brother--not the brother you had left, not the brother you knew, not him to whom you had with mutual tears bidden farewell as be followed you on your departure for your province: not a trace even or faint image of him, but rather what I may call the likeness of a living corpse.",
"And oh that you had sooner seen me or heard of me as a corpse!",
"Oh that I could have left you to survive, not my life merely, but my undiminished rank!",
"But I call all the gods to witness that the one argument which recalled me from death was, that all declared that to some extent your life depended upon mine.",
"In which matter I made an error and acted culpably.",
"For if I had died, that death itself would have given clear evidence of my fidelity and love to you.",
"As it is, I have allowed you to be deprived of my aid, though I am alive, and with me still living to need the help of others; and my voice, of all others, to fail when dangers threatened my family, which had so often been successfully used in the defense of the merest strangers.",
"For as to the slaves coming to you without a letter, the real reason (for you see that it was not anger) was a deadness of my faculties, and a seemingly endless deluge of tears and sorrows.",
"How many tears do you suppose these very words have cost me?",
"As many as I know they will cost you to read them!",
"Can I ever refrain from thinking of you or ever think of you without tears?",
"For when I miss you, is it only a brother that I miss?",
"Rather it is a brother of almost my own age in the charm of his companionship, a son in his consideration for my wishes, a father in the wisdom of his advice!",
"What pleasure did I ever have without you, or you without me?",
"And what must my case be when at the same time I miss a daughter: How affectionate!",
"how modest!",
"how clever!",
"The express image of my face, of my speech, of my very soul!",
"Or again a son, the prettiest boy, the very joy of my heart?",
"Cruel inhuman monster that I am, I dismissed him from my arms better schooled in the world than I could have wished: for the poor child began to understand what was going on.",
"So, too, your own son, your own image, whom my little Cicero loved as a brother, and was now beginning to respect as an elder brother!",
"Need I mention also how I refused to allow my unhappy wife--the truest of helpmates--to accompany me, that there might be some one to protect the wrecks of the calamity which had fallen on us both, and guard our common children?",
"Nevertheless, to the best of my ability, I did write a letter to you, and gave it to your freedman Philogonus, which, I believe, was delivered to you later on; and in this I repeat the advice and entreaty, which had been already transmitted to you as a message from me by my slaves, that you should go on with your journey and hasten to Rome.",
"For, in the first place, I desired your protection, in case there were any of my enemies whose cruelty was not yet satisfied by my fall.",
"In the next place, I dreaded the renewed lamentation which our meeting would cause: while I could not have borne your departure, and was afraid of the very thing you mention in your letter--that you would be unable to tear yourself away.",
"For these reasons the supreme pain of not seeing you--and nothing more painful or more wretched could, I think, have happened to the most affectionate and united of brothers--was a less misery than would have been such a meeting followed by such a parting.",
"Now, if you can, though I, whom you always regarded as a brave man, cannot do so, rouse yourself and collect your energies in view of any contest you may have to confront.",
"I hope, if my hope has anything to go upon, that your own spotless character and the love of your fellow citizens, and even remorse for my treatment, may prove a certain protection to you.",
"But if it turns out that you are free from personal danger, you will doubtless do whatever you think can be done for me.",
"In that matter, indeed, many write to me at great length and declare they have hopes; but I personally cannot see what hope there is, since my enemies have the greatest influence, while my friends have in some cases deserted, in others even betrayed me, fearing perhaps in my restoration a censure on their own treacherous conduct.",
"But how matters stand with you I would have you ascertain and report to me.",
"In any case I shall continue to live as long as you shall need me, in view of any danger you may have to undergo: longer than that I cannot go in this kind of life.",
"For there is neither wisdom nor philosophy with sufficient strength to sustain such a weight of grief.",
"I know that there has been a time for dying, more honorable and more advantageous; and this is not the only one of my many omissions; which, if I should choose to bewail, I should merely be increasing your sorrow and emphasizing my own stupidity.",
"But one thing I am not bound to do, and it is in fact impossible--remain in a life so wretched and so dishonored any longer than your necessities, or some well-grounded hope, shall demand.",
"For I, who was lately supremely blessed in brother, children, wife, wealth, and in the very nature of that wealth, while in position, influence, reputation, and popularity, I was inferior to none, however, distinguished--I cannot, I repeat.",
"go on longer lamenting over myself and those dear to me in a life of such humiliation as this, and in a state of such utter ruin.",
"Wherefore, what do you mean by writing to me about negotiating a bill of exchange?",
"As though I were not now wholly dependent on your means!",
"And that is just the very thing in which 1 see and feel, to my misery, of what a culpable act I have been guilty in squandering to no purpose the money which I received from the treasury in your name, while you have to satisfy your creditors out of the very vitals of yourself and your son.",
"However, the sum mentioned in your letter has been paid to M. Antonius, and the same amount to Caepio.",
"For me the sum at present in my hands is sufficient for what I contemplate doing.",
"For in either case--whether I am restored or given up in despair--I shall not want any more money.",
"For yourself, if you are molested, I think you should apply to Crassus and Calidius.",
"I don't know how far Hortensius is to be trusted.",
"Myself, with the most elaborate presence of affection and the closest daily intimacy, he treated with the most utter want of principle and thc most consummate treachery, and Q. Arrius helped him in it: acting under whose advice, promises, and injunctions, I was left helpless to fall into this disaster.",
"But this you will keep dark for fear they might injure you.",
"Take care also--and it is on this account that I think you should cultivate Hortensius himself by means of Pomponius--that the epigram on the irs Aurelia attributed to you when candidate for the aedileship is not proved by false testimony to be yours.",
"For there is nothing that I am so afraid of as that, when people understand how much pity for me your prayers and your acquittal will rouse, they may attack you with all the greater violence.",
"Messahla I reckon as really attached to you: Pompey I regard as still pretending only.",
"But may you never have to put these things to the test!",
"And that prayer I would have offered to the gods had they not ceased to listen to prayers of mine.",
"However, I do pray that they may be content with these endless miseries of ours; among which, after all, there is no discredit for any wrong thing done--sorrow is the beginning and end, sorrow that punishment is most severe when our conduct has been most unexceptionable.",
"As to my daughter and yours and my young Cicero, why should I recommend them to you, my dear brother?",
"Rather I grieve that their orphan state will cause you no less sorrow than it does me.",
"Yet as long as you are uncondemned they will not be fatherless.",
"The rest, by my hopes of restoration and the privilege of dying in my fatherland, my tears will not allow me to write!",
"Terentia also I would ask you to protect, and to write me word on every subject.",
"Be as brave as the nature of the case admits.",
"Directly I arrived at Rome, and there was anyone to whom I could safely intrust a letter for you, I thought the very first thing I ought to do was to congratulate you in your absence on my return.",
"For I knew, to speak candidly, that though in giving me advice you had not been more courageous or far-seeing than myself, nor-- considering my devotion to you in the past--too careful in protecting me from disaster, yet that you--though sharing in the first instance in my mistake, or rather madness, and in my groundless terror--had nevertheless been deeply grieved at our separation, and had bestowed immense pains, zeal, care, and labour in securing my return.",
"Accordingly, I can truly assure you of this, that in the midst of supreme joy and the most gratifying congratulations, the one thing wanting to fill my cup of happiness to the brim is the sight of you, or rather your embrace; and if I ever forfeit that again, when I have once got possession of it, and if, too, I do not exact the full delights of your charming society that have fallen into arrear in the past, I shall certainly consider myself unworthy of this renewal of my good fortune.",
"In regard to my political position, I have resumed what I thought there would be the utmost difficulty in recovering--my brilliant standing at the bar, my influence in the senate, and a popularity with the loyalists even greater than I desired.",
"In regard, however, to my private property--as to which you are well aware to what an extent it has been crippled, scattered, and plundered--I am in great difficulties, and stand in need, not so much of your means (which I look upon as my own), as of your advice for collecting and restoring to a sound state the fragments that remain.",
"For the present, though I believe everything finds its way to you in the letters of your friends, or even by messengers and rumor, yet I will write briefly what I think you would like to learn from my letters above all others.",
"On the 4th of August I started from Dyrrarhium, the very day on which the law about me was carried.",
"I arrived at Brundisium on the 5th of August.",
"There my dear Tulhiola met me on what was her own birthday, which happened also to be the name-day of the colony of Brundisium and of the temple of Safety, near your house.",
"This coincidence was noticed and celebrated with warm congratulations by the citizens of Brundisium.",
"On the 8th of August, while still at Brundisium, I learnt by a letter from Quintus that the law had been passed at the comitia centuriata with a surprising enthusiasm on the part of all ages and ranks, and with an incredible influx of voters from Italy.",
"I then commenced my journey, amidst the compliments of the men of highest consideration at Brundisium, and was met at every point by legates bearing congratulations.",
"My arrival in the neighbourhood of the city was the signal for every soul of every order known to my nomenclator coming out to meet me, except those enemies who could not either dissemble or deny the fact of their being such.",
"On my arrival at the Porta Capena, the steps of the temples were already thronged from top to bottom by the populace; and while their congratulations were displayed by the loudest possible applause, a similar throng and similar applause accompanied me right up to the Capitol, and in the forum and on the Capitol itself there was again a wonderful crowd.",
"Next day, in the senate, that is, the 5th of September, I spoke my thanks to the senators.",
"Two days after that--there having been a very heavy rise in the price of corn, and great crowds having flocked first to the theatre and then to the senate-house, shouting out, at the instigation of Clodius, that the scarcity of corn was my doing--meetings of the senate being held on those days to discuss the corn question, and Pompey being called upon to undertake the management of its supply in the common talk not only of the plebs, but of the aristocrats also, and being himself desirous of the commission, when the people at large called upon me by name to support a decree to that effect, I did so, and gave my vote in a carefully-worded speech.",
"The other consulars, except Messalla and Afranius, having absented themselves on the ground that they could not vote with safety to themselves, a decree of the senate was passed in the sense of my motion, namely, that Pompey should be appealed to to undertake the business, and that a law should be proposed to that effect.",
"This decree of the senate having been publicly read, and the people having, after the senseless and new-fangled custom that now prevails, applauded the mention of my name, I delivered a speech.",
"All the magistrates present, except one praetor and two tribunes, called on me to speak.",
"Next day a full senate, including all the consulars, granted everything that Pompey asked for.",
"Having demanded fifteen legates, he named me first in the list, and said that he should regard me in all things as a second self.",
"The consuls drew up a law by which complete control over the corn-supply for five years throughout the whole world was given to Pompey.",
"A second law is drawn up by Messius, granting him power over all money, and adding a fleet and army, and an imperium in the provinces superior to that of their governors.",
"After that our consular law seems moderate indeed: that of Messius is quite intolerable.",
"Pompey professes to prefer the former; his friends the latter.",
"The consulars led by Favonius murmur: I hold my tongue, the more so that the pontifices have as yet given no answer in regard to my house.",
"If they annul the consecration I shall have a splendid site.",
"The consuls, in accordance with a decree of the senate, will value the cost of the building that stood upon it; but if the pontifices decide otherwise, they will pull down the Clodian building, give out a contract in their own name (for a temple), and value to me the cost of a site and house.",
"So our affairs are "For happy though but ill, for ill not worst."",
"In regard to money matters I am, as you know, much embarrassed.",
"Besides, there are certain domestic troubles, which I do not intrust to writing.",
"My brother Quintus I love as he deserves for his eminent qualities of loyalty, virtue, and good faith.",
"I am longing to see you, and beg you to hasten your return, resolved not to allow me to be without the benefit of your advice.",
"I am on the threshold, as it were, of a second life.",
"Already certain persons who defended me in my absence begin to nurse a secret grudge at me now that I am here, and to make no secret of their jealousy.",
"I want you very much.",
"I HAVE already told you the earlier proceedings; now let me describe what was done afterwards.",
"The legations were postponed from the 1st of February to the 13th.",
"On the former day our business was not brought to a settlement.",
"On the 2nd of February Milo appeared for trial.",
"Pompey came to support him.",
"Marcellus spoke on being called upon by me.",
"We came off with flying colors.",
"The case was adjourned to the 7th.",
"Meanwhile (in the senate), the legations having been postponed to the 13th, the business of allotting the quaestors and furnishing the outfit of the praetors was brought before the house.",
"But nothing was done, because many speeches were interposed denouncing the state of the Republic.",
"Gaius Cato published his bill for the recall of Lentulus, whose son thereon put on mourning.",
"On the 7th Milo appeared.",
"Pompey spoke, or rather wished to speak.",
"For as soon as he got up Clodius's ruffians raised a shout, and throughout his whole speech he was interrupted, not only by hostile cries, but by personal abuse and insulting remarks.",
"However, when lie had finished his speech--for he showed great courage in these circumstances, he was not cowed, he said all he had to say, and at times had by his commanding presence even secured silence for his words--well, when he had finished, up got Clodius.",
"Our party received him with such a shout--for they had determined to pay him out--that he lost all presence of mind, power of speech, or control over his countenance.",
"This went on up to two o clock--Pompey having finished his speech at noon--and every kind of abuse, and finally epigrams of the most outspoken indecency were uttered against Clodius and Clodia.",
"Mad and livid with rage Clodius, in the very midst of the shouting, kept putting questions to his claque: "Who was it who was starving the commons to death?"",
"His ruffians answered, "Pompey."",
""Who wanted to be sent to Alexandria ?"",
"They answered, "Pompey."",
""Who did they wish to go ?"",
"They answered, "Crassus."",
"The latter was present at the time with no friendly feelings to Milo.",
"About three o clock, as though at a given signal, the Clodians began spitting at our men.",
"There was an outburst of rage.",
"They began a movement for forcing us from our ground.",
"Our men charged: his ruffians turned tail.",
"Clodius was pushed off the rostra: and then we too made our escape for fear of mischief in the riot.",
"The senate was summoned into the Curia: Pompey went home.",
"However, I did not myself enter the senate-house, lest I should be obliged either to refrain from speaking on matters of such gravity, or in defending Pompey (for he was being attacked by Bibulus, Curio, Favonius, and Servilius the younger) should give offense to the loyalists.",
"The business was adjourned to the next day.",
"Clodius fixed the Quirinalia (17th of February) for his prosecution.",
"On the 8th the senate met in the temple of Apollo, that Pompey might attend.",
"Pompey made an impressive speech.",
"That day nothing was concluded.",
"On the 9th in the temple of Apollo a degree passed the senate "that what had taken place on the 7th of February was treasonable."",
"On this day Cato warmly inveighed against Pompey, and throughout his speech arraigned him as though he were at the bar.",
"He said a great deal about me, to my disgust, though it was in very laudatory terms.",
"When he attacked Pompey's perfidy to me, he was listened to in profound silence on the part of my enemies.",
"Pompey answered him boldly with a palpable allusion to Crassus, and said outright that "he would take better precautions to protect his life than Africanus had done, whom C. Carbo had assassinated."",
"Accordingly, important events appear to me to be in the wind.",
"For Pompey understands what is going on, and imparts to me that plots are being formed against his life, that Gaius Cato is being supported by Crassus, that money is being supplied to Clodius, that both are backed by Crassus and Curio, as well as by Bibulus and his other detractors: that he must take extraordinary precautions to prevent being overpowered by that demagogue--with a people all but wholly alienated, a nobility hostile, a senate ill-affected, and the younger men corrupt.",
"So he is making his preparations and summoning men from the country.",
"On his part, Clodius is rallying his gangs: a body of men is being got together for the Quirinalia.",
"For that occasion we are considerably in a majority, owing to the forces brought up by Pompey himself: and a large contingent is expected from Picenum and Gallia, to enable us to throw out Cato's bills also about Milo and Lentulus.",
"On the 10th of February an indictment was lodged against Sestius for bribery by the informer Cn.",
"Nerius, of the Pupinian tribe, arid on the same day by a certain M. Tullius for riot.",
"He was ill.",
"I went at once, as I was bound to do.",
"to his house, and put myself wholly at his service: and that was more than people expected, who thought that I had good cause for being angry with him.",
"The result is that my extreme kindness and grateful disposition are made manifest both to Sestius himself and to all the world, and I shall be as good as my word.",
"But this same informer Nerius also named Cn.",
"Lentulus Vatia and C. Cornelius to the commissioners.",
"On the same day a decree passed the senate "that political clubs and associations should be broken up, and that a law in regard to them should be brought in, enacting that those who did not break off from them should be liable to the same penalty as those convicted of riot."",
"On the 10th of February I spoke in defense of Bestia on a charge of bribery before the praetor Cn.",
"Domitius, in the middle of the forum and in a very crowded court; and in the course of my speech I came to the incident of Sestius, after receiving many wounds in the temple of Castor, having been preserved by the aid of Bestia.",
"Here I took occasion to pave the way beforehand for a refutation of the charges which are being got up against Sestius, and I passed a well-deserved encomium upon him with the cordial approval of everybody.",
"He was himself very much delighted with it.",
"I tell you this because you have often advised me in your letters to retain the friendship of Sestius.",
"I am writing this on the 12th of February before daybreak; the day on which I am to dine with Pomponius on the occasion of his wedding.",
"Our position in other respects is such as you used to cheer my despondency by telling me it would be--one of great dignity and popularity: this is a return to old times for you and me effected, my brother, by your patience, high character, loyalty, and, I may also add, your conciliatory manners.",
"The house of Licinius, near the grove of Piso, has been taken for you.",
"But, as I hope, in a few months  time, after the 1st of July, you will move into your own.",
"Some excellent tenants, the Lamiae, have taken your house in Carinie.",
"I have received no letter from you since the one dated Olbia.",
"I am anxious to hear how you are and what you find to amuse you, but above all to see you yourself as soon as possible.",
"Take care of your health, my dear brother, and though it is winter time, yet reflect that after all it is Sardinia that you are in.",
"It will be delightful if you come to see us here.",
"You will find that Tyrannio has made a wonderfully good arrangement of my books, the remains of which are better than I had expected.",
"Still, I wish you would send me a couple of your library slaves for Tyrannio to employ as gluers, and in other subordinate work, and tell them to get some fine parchment to make title-pieces, which you Greeks, I think, call "sillybi."",
"But all this is only if not inconvenient to you.",
"In any case, be sure you come yourself, if you can halt for a while in such a place, and can persuade Pilia to accompany you.",
"For that is only fair, and Tulia is anxious that she should come.",
"My word!",
"You have purchased a fine troop!",
"Your gladiators, I am told, fight superbly.",
"If you had chosen to let them out you would have cleared your expenses by the last two spectacles.",
"But we will talk about this later on.",
"Be sure to come, and, as you love me, see about the library slaves.",
"I have often tried to say to you personally what I am about to write, but was prevented by a kind of almost clownish bashfulness.",
"Now that I am not in your presence I shall speak out more boldly: a letter does not blush.",
"I am inflamed with an inconceivably ardent desire, and one, as I think, of which I have no reason to be ashamed, that in a history written by you my name should be conspicuous and frequently mentioned with praise.",
"And though you have often shown me that you meant to do so, yet I hope you will pardon my impatience.",
"For the style of your composition, though I had always entertained the highest expectations of it, has yet surpassed my hopes, and has taken such a hold upon me, or rather has so fired my imagination, that I was eager to have my achievements as quickly as possible put on record in your history.",
"For it is not only the thought of being spoken of by future ages that makes me snatch at what seems a hope of immortality, but it is also the desire of fully enjoying in my lifetime an authoritative expression of your judgment, or a token of your kindness for me, or the charm of your genius.",
"Not, however, that while thus writing I am unaware under what heavy burdens you are laboring in the portion of history you have undertaken, and by this time have begun to write.",
"But because I saw that your history of the Italian and Civil Wars was now all but finished, and because also you told me that you were already embarking upon the remaining portions of your work, I determined not to lose my chance for the want of suggesting to you to consider whether you preferred to weave your account of me into the main context of your history, or whether, as many Greek writers have done--Callisthenes, the Phocian War; Timeus, the war of Pyrrhus; Polybius, that of Numantia; all of whom separated the wars I have named from their main narratives--you would, like them, separate the civil conspiracy from public and external wars.",
"For my part, I do not see that it matters much to my reputation, but it does somewhat concern my impatience, that you should not wait till you come to the proper place, but should at once anticipate the discussion of that question as a whole and the history of that epoch.",
"And at the same time, if your whole thoughts are engaged on one incident and one person, I can see in imagination how much fuller your material will be, and how much more elaborately worked out.",
"I am quite aware, however, what little modesty I display, first, in imposing on you so heavy a burden (for your engagements may well prevent your compliance with my request), and in the second place, in asking you to show me off to advantage.",
"What if those transactions are not in your judgment so very deserving of commendation?",
"Yet, after all, a man who has once passed the border-line of modesty had better put a bold face on it and be frankly impudent.",
"And so I again and again ask you outright, both to praise those actions of mine in warmer terms than you perhaps feel, and in that respect to neglect the laws of history.",
"I ask you, too, in regard to the personal predilection, on which you wrote in a certain introductory chapter in the most gratifying and explicit terms--and by which you show that you were as incapable of being diverted as Xenophon's Hercules by Pleasure--not to go against it, but to yield to your affection for me a little more than truth shall justify.",
"But if I can induce you to undertake this, you will have, I am persuaded, matter worthy of your genius and your wealth of language.",
"For from the beginning of the conspiracy to my return from exile it appears to me that a moderate-sized monograph might be composed, in which you will, on the one hand, be able to utilize your special knowledge of civil disturbances, either in unravelling the causes of the revolution or in proposing remedies for evils, blaming meanwhile what you think deserves denunciation, and establishing the righteousness of what you approve by explaining the principles on which they rest: and on the other hand, if you think it right to be more outspoken (as you generally do), you will bring out the perfidy, intrigues, and treachery of many people towards me.",
"For my vicissitudes will supply you in your composition with much variety, which has in itself a kind of charm, capable of taking a strong hold on the imagination of readers, when you are the writer.",
"For nothing is better fitted to interest a reader than variety of circumstance and vicissitudes of fortune, which, though the reverse of welcome to us in actual experience, will make very pleasant reading: for the untroubled recollection of a past sorrow has a charm of its own.",
"To the rest of the world, indeed, who have had no trouble themselves, and who look upon the misfortunes of others without any suffering of their own, the feeling of pity is itself a source of pleasure.",
"For what man of us is not delighted, though feeling a certain compassion too, with the death-scene of Epaminondas at Mantinea?",
"He, you know, did not allow the dart to be drawn from his body until he had been told, in answer to his question, that his shield was safe, so that in spite of the agony of his wound he died calmly and with glory.",
"Whose interest is not roused and sustained by the banishment and return of Themistocles?",
"Truly the mere chronological record of the annals has very little charm for us--little more than the entries in the fasti: but the doubtful and varied fortunes of a man, frequently of eminent character, involve feelings of wonder, suspense, joy, sorrow, hope, fear: if these fortunes are crowned with a glorious death, the imagination is satisfied with the most fascinating delight which reading can give.",
"Therefore it will be more in accordance with my wishes if you come to the resolution to separate from the main body of your narrative, in which you embrace a continuance history of events, what I may call the drama of my actions and fortunes: for it includes varied acts, and shifting scenes both of policy and circumstance.",
"Nor am I afraid of appearing to lay snares for your favor by flattering suggestions, when I declare that I desire to be complimented and mentioned with praise by you above all other writers.",
"For you are not the man to be ignorant of your own powers, or not to be sure that those who withhold their admiration of you are more to be accounted jealous, than those who praise you flatterers.",
"Nor, again, am I so senseless as to wish to be consecrated to an eternity of fame by one who, in so consecrating me, does not also gain for himself the glory which rightfully belongs to genius.",
"For the famous Alexander himself did not wish to be painted by Apelles, and to have his statue made by Lysippus above all others, merely from personal favor to them, but because he thought that their art would be a glory at once to them and to himself.",
"And, indeed, those artists used to make images of the person known to strangers: but if such had never existed, illustrious men would yet be no less illustrious.",
"The Spartan Agesilaus, who would not allow a portrait of himself to be painted or a statue made, deserves to be quoted as an example quite as much as those who have taken trouble about such representations: for a single pamphlet of Xenophon's in praise of that king has proved much more effective than all the portraits and statues of them all, And, moreover, it will more redound to my present exultation and the honor of my memory to have found my way into your history, than if I had done so into that of others, in this, that I shall profit not only by the genius of the writer--as Timoleon did by that of Timaeus, Themistocles by that of Herodotus--but also by the authority of a man of a most illustrious and well-established character, and one well known and of the first repute for his conduct in the most important and weighty matters of state; so that I shall seem to have gained not only the fame which Alexander on his visit to Sigeum said had been bestowed on Achilles by Homer, but also the weighty testimony of a great and illustrious man.",
"For I like that saying of Hector in Naevius, who not only rejoices that he is "praised," but adds, "and by one who has himself been praised."",
"But if I fail to obtain my request from you, which is equivalent to saying, if you are by some means prevented--for I hold it to be out of the question that you would refuse a request of mine--I shall perhaps be forced to do what certain persons have often found fault with, write my own panegyric, a thing, after all, which has a precedent of many illustrious men.",
"But it will not escape your notice that there are the following drawbacks in a composition of that sort: men are bound, when writing of themselves, both to speak with greater reserve of what is praiseworthy, and to omit what calls for blame.",
"Added to which such writing carries less conviction, less weight; many people, in fine, carp at it, and say that the heralds at the public games are more modest, far after having placed garlands on the other recipients and proclaimed their names in a loud voice, when their own turn comes to be presented with a garland before the games break up, they call in the services of another herald, that they may not declare themselves victors with their own voice.",
"I wish to avoid all this, and, if you undertake my cause, I shall avoid it: and, accordingly, I ask you this favor.",
"But why, you may well ask, when you have already often assured me that yOu intended to record in your book with the utmost minuteness the policy and events of my consulship, do I now make this request to you with such earnestness and in so many words?",
"The reason is to be found in that burning desire, of which I spoke at the beginning of my letter, for something prompt: because I am in a flutter of impatience, both that men should learn what I am from your book, while I am still alive, and that I may myself in my lifetime have the full enjoyment of my little bit of glory.",
"What you intend doing on this subject I should like you to write me word, if not troublesome to you.",
"For if you do undertake the subject, I will put together sonic notes of all occurrences: but if you put me off to some future time, I will talk the matter over with you.",
"Meanwhile, do not relax your efforts, and thoroughly polish what you have already on the stocks, and--continue to love me.",
"I had only just arrived from Arpinum when your letter was delivered to me; and from the same bearer I received a letter from Avianius, in which there was this most liberal offer, that when he came to Rome he would enter my debt to him on whatever day I chose.",
"Pray put yourself in my place: is it consistent with your modesty or mine, first to prefer a request as to the day, and then to ask more than a year's credit?",
"But, my dear Gallus, everything would have been easy, if you had bought the things I wanted, and only up to the price that I wished.",
"However, the purchases which, according to your letter, you have made shall not only be ratified by me, but with gratitude besides: for I fully understand that you have displayed zeal and affection in purchasing (because you thought them worthy of me) things which pleased yourself--a man, as I have ever thought, of the most fastidious judgment in all matters of taste.",
"Still, I should like Damasippus to abide by his decision: for there is absolutely none of those purchases that I care to have.",
"But you, being unacquainted with my habits, have bought four or five of your selection at a price at which I do not value any statues in the world.",
"You compare your Bacchae with Metellus's Muses.",
"Where is the likeness?",
"To begin with, I should never have considered the Muses worth all that money, and I think all the Muses would have approved my judgment: still, it would have been appropriate to a library, and in harmony with my pursuits But Bacchae!",
"What place is there in my house for them?",
"But, you will say, they are pretty.",
"I know them very well and have often seem them.",
"I would have commissioned you definitely in the case of statues known to me, if I had decided on them.",
"The sort of statues that I am accustomed to buy are such as may adorn a place in a palastra after the fashion of gymnasia.",
"What, again, have I, the promoter of peace, to do with a statue of Mars?",
"I am glad there was not a statue of Saturn also: for I should have thought these two statues had brought mc debt!",
"I should have preferred some representation of Mercury: I might then, I suppose, have made a more favourable bargain with Arrianus.",
"You say you meant the table-stand for yourself; well, if you like it, keep it.",
"But if you have changed your mind I will, of course, have it.",
"For the money you have laid out, indeed, I would rather have purchased a place of call at Tarracina, to prevent my being always a burden on my host.",
"Altogether I perceive that the fault is with my freedman, whom I had distinctly commissioned to purchase certain definite things, and also with Lunius, whom I think you know, an intimate friend of Avianius.",
"I have constructed some new sitting-rooms in a miniature colonnade on my Tusculan property.",
"I want to ornament them with pictures: for if I take pleasure in anything of that sort it is in painting.",
"However, if I am to have what you have bought, I should like you to inform me where they are, when they are to be fetched, and by what kind of conveyance.",
"For if Damasippus doesn't abide by his decision, I shall look for some would-be Damasippus, even at a loss.",
"As to what you say about the house, as I was going out of town I intrusted the matter to my daughter Tullia: for it 'vas at the very hour of my departure that I got your letter.",
"I also discussed the matter with your friend Nicias, because he is, as you know, intimate with Cassius.",
"On my return, however, before I got your last letter, I asked Tullia what she had done.",
"She said that she had approached Licinia (though I think Cassius is not very intimate with his sister), and that she at once said that she could venture, in the absence of her husband (Dexius is gone to Spain), to change houses without his being there and knowing about it..",
"I am much gratified that you should value association with me and my domestic life so highly, as, in the first place, to take a house which would enable you to live not only near me, but absolutely with me, and, in the second place, to be in such a hurry to make this change of residence.",
"But, upon my life, I do not yield to you in eagerness for that arrangement.",
"So I will try every means in my power.",
"For I see the advantage to myself, and, indeed, the advantages to us both.",
"If I succeed in doing anything, I will let you know.",
"Mind you also write me word back on everything, and let me know, if you please, when I am to expect you.",
"If some bodily pain or weakness of health has prevented your coming to the games, I put it down to fortune rather than your own wisdom: but if you have made up your mind that these things which the rest of the world admires are only worthy of contempt, and, though your health would have allowed of it, you yet were unwilling to come, then I rejoice at both facts--that you were free from bodily pain, and that you had the sound sense to disdain what others causelessly admire.",
"Only I hope that some fruit of your leisure may be forthcoming, a leisure, indeed, which you had a splendid opportunity of enjoying to the full, seeing that you were left almost alone in your lovely country.",
"For I doubt not that in that study of yours, from which you have opened a window into the Stabian waters of the bay, and obtained a view of Misenum, you have spent the morning hours of those days in light reading, while those who left you there were watching the ordinary farces half asleep.",
"The remaining parts of the day, too, you spent in the pleasures which you had yourself arranged to suit your own taste, while we had to endure whatever had met with the approval of Spurius Maecius.",
"On the whole, if you care to know, the games were most splendid, but not to your taste.",
"I judge from my own.",
"For, to begin with, as a special honor to the occasion, those actors had come back to the stage who, I thought, had left it for their own.",
"Indeed, your favorite, my friend Aesop, was in such a state that no one could say a word against his retiring from the profession.",
"On beginning to recite the oath his voice failed him at the words "If  I knowingly deceive."",
"Why should I go on with the story?",
"You know all about the rest of the games, which hadn't even that amount of charm which games on a moderate scale generally have: for the spectacle was so elaborate as to leave no room for cheerful enjoyment, and I think you need feel no regret at having missed it.",
"For what is the pleasure of a train of six hundred mules in the "Clytemnestra," or three thousand bowls in the "Trojan Horse," or gay-colored armor of infantry and cavalry in some battle?",
"These things roused the admiration of the vulgar; to you they would have brought no delight.",
"But if during those days you listened to your reader Protogenes, so long at least as he read anything rather than my speeches, surely you had far greater pleasure than any one of us.",
"For I don't suppose you wanted to see Greek or Oscan plays, especially as you can see Oscan farces in your senate-house over there, while you are so far from liking Greeks, that you generally won't even go along the Greek road to your villa Why, again, should I suppose you to care about missing the athletes, since you disdained the gladiators?",
"in which even Pompey himself confesses that he lost his trouble and his pains.",
"There remain the two wild-beast hunts, lasting five days, magnificent--nobody denies it--and yet, what pleasure can it be to a man of refinement, when either a weak man is torn by an extremely powerful animal, or a splendid animal is transfixed by a hunting spear?",
"Things which, after all, if worth seeing, you have often seen before; nor did I, who was present at the games, see anything the least new.",
"The last day was that of the elephants, on which there was a great deal of astonishment on the part of the vulgar crowd, but no pleasure whatever.",
"However, for my part, during this day, while the theatrical exhibitions were on, lest by chance you should think me too blessed, I almost split my lungs in defending your friend Caninius Gallus.",
"But if the people were as indulgent to me as they were to Aesop, I would, by heaven, have been glad to abandon my profession and live with you and others like us.",
"The fact is I was tired of it before, even when both age and ambition stirred me on, and when I could also decline any defense that I didn't like; but now, with things in the state that they are, there is no life worth having.",
"For, on the one hand, I expect no profit of my labor; and, on the other, I am sometimes forced to defend men who have been no friends to me, at the request of those to whom I am under obligations.",
"Accordingly, I am on the look-out for every excuse for at last managing my life according to my own taste, and I loudly applaud and vehemently approve both you and your retired plan of life: and as to your infrequent appearances among us, I am the more resigned to that because, were you in Rome, I should be prevented from enjoying the charm of your society, and so would you of mine, if I have any, by the overpowering nature of my engagements; from which, if I get any relief--for entire release I don't expect--I will give even you, who have been studying nothing else for many years, some hints as to what it is to live a life of cultivated enjoyment.",
"Only be careful to nurse your weak health and to continue your present care of it, so that you may be able to visit my country houses and make excursions with me in my litter.",
"I have written you a longer letter than usual, from superabundance, not of leisure, but of affection, because, if you remember, you asked me in one of your letters to write you something to prevent you feeling sorry at having missed the games.",
"And if I have succeeded in that, I am glad: if not, I yet console myself with this reflexion, that in future you will both come to the games and come to see me, and will not leave your hope of enjoyment dependent on my letters.",
"After extraordinary hot weather--I never remember greater heat--I have refreshed myself at Arpinum, and enjoyed the extreme loveliness of the river during the days of the games, having left my tribesmen under the charge of Philotimus.",
"I was at Arcanum on the 10th of September.",
"There I found Mescidius and Philoxenus, and saw the water, for which they were making a course not far from your villa, running quite nicely, especially considering the extreme drought, and they said they were going to collect it in much greater abundance.",
"Everything is right with Herus.",
"In your Manilian property I came across Diphilus outdoing himself in dilatoriness.",
"Still, he had nothing left to construct, except baths, and a promenade, and an aviary.",
"I liked that villa very much, because its paved colonnade gives it an air of very great dignity.",
"I never appreciated this till now that the colonnade itself has been all laid open, and the columns have been polished.",
"It all depends--and this I will look to--upon the stuccoing being prettily done.",
"The pavements seemed to be being well laid.",
"Certain of the ceilings I did not like, and ordered them to be changed.",
"As to the place in which they say that you write word that a small entrance hall is to be built--namely, in the colonnade--I liked it better as it is.",
"For 1 did not think there was space sufficient for an entrance hall; nor is it usual to have one, except in those buildings which have a larger court; nor could it have bedrooms and apartments of that kind attached to it.",
"As it is, from the very beauty of its arched roof, it will serve as an admirable summer room.",
"However, if you think differently, write back word as soon as possible.",
"In the bath I have moved the hot chamber to the other corner of the dressing-room, because it was so placed that its steampipe was immediately under the bedrooms.",
"A fair-sized bed-room and a lofty winter one I admired very much, for they were both spacious and well-situated--on the side of the promenade nearest to the bath.",
"Diphilus had placed the columns out of the perpendicular, and not opposite each other.",
"These, of course, he shall take down; he will learn some day to use the plumb-line and measure.",
"On the whole, I hope Diphilus's work will be completed in a few months: for Qesius, who was with me at the time, keeps a very sharp look-out upon him.",
"Thence I started straight along the via Vitularia to your Fufidianum, the estate which we bought for you a few weeks ago at Arpinum for 100,000 sesterces.",
"I never saw a shadier spot in summer--water springs in many parts of it, and abundant into the bargain.",
"In short, Caesius thought that you would easily irrigate fifty iugera of the meadow land.",
"For my part, I can assure you of this, which is more in my line, that you will have a villa marvelously pleasant, with the addition of a fish-pond, spouting fountains, a pakestra, and a shrubbery.",
"I am told that you wish to keep this Bovillae estate.",
"You will determine as you think good.",
"Calvus said that, even if the control of the water were taken from you, and the right of drawing it off were established by the vendor, and thus an easement were imposed on that property, we could yet maintain the price in case we wish to sell.",
"He said that he had agreed with you to do the work at three sesterces a foot, and that he had stepped it, and made it three miles.",
"It seemed to me more.",
"But I will guarantee that the money could nowhere be better laid out.",
"I had sent for Cillo from Venafrum, but on that very day four of his fellow servants and apprentices bad been crushed by the falling in of a tunnel at Venafrum.",
"On the 23th of September I was at Laterium.",
"I examined the road, which appeared to me to be so good as to Seem almost like a high road, except a hundred and fifty paces--for I measured it myself from the little bridge at the temple of Furina, in the direction of Satricum.",
"There they had put down dust, not gravel (this shall he changed), and that part of the road is a very steep incline.",
"But I understood that it could not be taken in any other direction, particularly as you did not wish it to go through the property of Locusta or Varro.",
"The latter alone had made the road very well where it skirted his own property.",
"Locusta hadn't touched it; but I will call on him at Rome, and think I shall be able to stir him up, and at the same tune I think I shall ask M. Tarus, who is now at Rome, and whom I am told promised to allow you to do so, about making a watercourse through his property.",
"I much approved of your steward Nicephorius and I asked him what orders you had given about that small building at Laterium, about which you spoke to me.",
"He told me in answer that he had himself contracted to do the work for sixteen sestertia (about 128 pounds), but that you had afterwards made many additions to the work, but nothing to the price, and that he had therefore given it up.",
"I quite approve by Hercules, of your making the additions you had determined upon; although the villa as it stands seems to have the air of a philosopher, meant to rebuke the extravagance of other villas.",
"Yet, after all, that addition will be pleasing.",
"I praised your landscape gardener: he has so covered everything with ivy, both the foundation-wall of the villa and the spaces between the columns of the walk, that, upon my word, those Greek statues seemed to be engaged in fancy gardening, and to be shewing off the ivy.",
"Finally, nothing can be cooler or more mossy than the dressing-room of the bath.",
"That is about all I have to say about country matters.",
"The gardener, indeed, as well as Philotimus and Cincius are pressing on the ornamentation of your town house; but I also often look in upon it myself, as I can do without difficulty.",
"Wherefore don't be at all anxious about that.",
"As to your always asking me about your son, of course I "excuse you"; but I must ask you to "excuse" me also, for I don't allow that you love him more than I do.",
"And oh that he had been with me these last few days at Arpinum, as he had himself set his heart on being, and as I had no less done!",
"As to Pomponia, please write and say that, when I go out of town anywhere, she is to come with me and bring the boy.",
"I'll do wonders with him, if I get him to myself when I am at leisure: for at Rome there is no time to breathe.",
"You know I formerly promised to do so for nothing.",
"What do you expect with such a reward as you promise me?",
"I now come to your letters which I received in several packets when I was at Arpinum.",
"For I received three from you in one day, and, indeed, as it seemed, despatched by you at the same time--one of considerable length, in which your first point was that my letter to you was dated earlier than that to Caesar.",
"Oppius at times cannot help this: the reason is that, having settled to send letter-carriers, and having received a letter from me, he is hindered by something turning up, and obliged to despatch them later than he had intended; and I don't take the trouble to have the day altered on a letter which I have once handed to him.",
"You write about Caesar's extreme affection for us.",
"This affection you must on your part keep warm, and I for mine will endeavor to increase it by every means in my power.",
"About Pompey, I am carefully acting, and shall continue to act, as you advise.",
"That my permission to you to stay longer is a welcome one, though I grieve at your absence and miss you exceedingly, 1 am yet partly glad.",
"What you can be thinking of in sending for such people as Hippodamus and some others, I do not understand.",
"There is not one of those fellows that won't expect a present from you equal to a suburban estate.",
"However, there is no reason for your classing my friend Trebatius with them.",
"I sent him to Caesar, and Caesar has done all I expected.",
"If he has not done quite what he expected himself, I am not bound to make it up to him, and I in like manner free and absolve you from all claims on his part.",
"Your remark, that you are a greater favorite with Caesar every day, is a source of undying satisfaction to me.",
"As to Balbus, who, as you say, promotes that state of things, he is the apple of my eye.",
"I am indeed glad that you and my friend Trebonius like each other.",
"As to what you say about the military tribuneship, I, indeed, asked for it definitely for Curtius, and Caeesar wrote back definitely to say that there was one at Curtius's service, and chided me for my modesty in making the request.",
"If I have asked one for anyone else--as I told Oppius to write and tell Caesar--I shall not be at all annoyed by a refusal, since those who pester me for letters are annoyed at a refusal from me.",
"I like Curtius, as I have told him, not only because you asked me to do so, but from the character you gave of him; for from your letter I have gathered the zeal he showed for my restoration.",
"As for the British expedition, I conclude from your letter that we have no occasion either for fear or exultation.",
"As to public affairs, about which you wish Tiro to write to you, I have written to you hitherto somewhat more carelessly than usual, because I knew that all events, small or great, were reported to Caesar.",
"I have now answered your longest letter.",
"Now hear what I have to say to your small one.",
"The first point is about Clodius's letter to Caesar.",
"In that matter I approve of Caesar's policy, in not having given way to your request so far as to write a single word to that Fury.",
"The next thing is about the speech of Calventius "Marius."",
"I am surprised at your saying that you think I ought to answer it, particularly as, while no one is likely to read that speech, unless I write an answer to it, every schoolboy learns mine against him as an exercise.",
"My books, all of which you are expecting, I have begun, but I cannot finish them for some days yet.",
"The speeches for Scaurus and Plancius which you clamor for I have finished.",
"The poem to Caesar, which I had begun, I have cut short.",
"I will write what you ask me for, since your poetic springs are running dry, as soon as I have time.",
"Now for the third letter.",
"It is very pleasant and welcome news to hear from you that Balbus is soon coming to Rome, and so well accompanied!",
"and will stay with me continuously till the 15th of May.",
"As to your exhorting me in the same letter, as in many previous ones, to ambition and labour, I shall, of course, do as you say: but when am I to enjoy any real life?",
"Your fourth letter reached me on the 13th of September, dated on the 10th of August from Britain.",
"In it there was nothing new except about your Erigona, and if I get that from Oppius I will write and tell you what I think of it.",
"I have no doubt I shall like it.",
"Oh yes!",
"I had almost forgotten to remark as to the man who, you say in your letter, had written to Qesar about the applause given to Milo-- I am not unwilling that Caesar should think that it was as warm as possible.",
"And in point of fact it was so, and yet that applause, which is given to him, seems in a certain sense to be given to me.",
"I have also received a very old letter, but which was late in coming into my hands, in which you remind me about the temple of Tellus and the colonnade of Catulus.",
"Both of these matters are being actively carried out.",
"At the temple of Tellus I have even got your statue placed.",
"So, again, as to your reminder about a suburban villa and gardens, I was never very keen for one, and now my town house has all the charm of such a pleasure-ground.",
"On my arrival in Rome on the 18th of September I found the roof on your house finished: the part over the sitting-rooms, which you did not wish to have many gables, now slopes gracefully towards the roof of the lower colonnade.",
"Our boy, in my absence, did not cease working with his rhetoric master.",
"You have no reason for being anxious about his education, for you know his ability, and I see his application.",
"Everything else I take it upon myself to guarantee, with full consciousness that I am bound to make it good.",
"As yet there are three parties prosecuting Gabinius: first, L. Lentulus, son of the flainen, who has entered a prosecution for lese majeste; secondly, Tib.",
"Nero with good names at the back of his indictment; thirdly, C. Memmius the tribune in conjunction with L. Capito.",
"He came to the walls of the city on the 19th of September, undignified and neglected to the last degree.",
"But in the present state of the law courts I do not venture to be confident of anything.",
"As Cato is unwell, he has not yet been formally indicted for extortion.",
"Pompey is trying hard to persuade me to be reconciled to him, but as yet he has not yet succeeded at all, nor, if I retain a shred of liberty, will he succeed.",
"I am very anxious for a letter from you.",
"You say that you have been told that I was a party to the coalition of the consular candidates--it is a lie.",
"The compacts male in that coalition afterwards made public by Memmius, were of such a nature that no loyal man ought to have been a party to them; nor at the same time was it possible for me to be a party to a coalition from which Messalla was excluded, who is thoroughly satisfied with my conduct in every particular, as also, I think, is Memmius.",
"To Domitius himself I have rendered many services which he desired and asked of me.",
"I have put Scaurus under a heavy obligation by my defense of him.",
"It is as yet very uncertain both when the elections will be and who will be consuls.",
"Just as I was folding up this epistle letter-carriers arrived from you and Caesar (20th September) after a journey of twenty days.",
"How anxious I was!",
"How painfully I was affected by Caesar's most kind letter!",
"But the kinder it was, the more sorrow did his loss occasion me.",
"But to turn to your letter.",
"To begin with, I reiterate my approval of your staying on, especially as, according to your account, you have consulted Caesar on the subject.",
"I wonder that Oppius has anything to do with Publius for I advised against it.",
"Farther on in your letter you say that I am going to be made legatus to Pompey on the 13th of September: I have heard nothing about it, and I wrote to Caesar to tell him that neither Vibullius nor Oppius had delivered his message to Pompey about my remaining at home.",
"Why, I know not.",
"However, it was I who restrained Oppius from doing so, because it was Vibullius who should take the leading part in that matter: for with him Caesar had communicated personally, with Oppius only by letter.",
"I indeed can have no "second thoughts" in matters connected with Caesar.",
"He comes next after you and our children in my regard, and not much after.",
"I think I act in this with deliberate judgment, for I have by this time good cause for it, yet warm personal feeling no doubt does influence me also.",
"Just as I had written these last words--which are by my own hand--your boy came in to dine with me, as Pomponia was dining out.",
"He gave me your letter to read, which he had received shortly before--a truly Aristophanic mixture of jest and earnest, with which I was greatly charmed.",
"He gave me also your second letter, in which you bid him cling to my side as a mentor.",
"How delighted he was with those letters!",
"And so was I.",
"Nothing could be more attractive than that boy, nothing more affectionate to me !--This, to explain its being in another handwriting, I dictated to Tiro while at dinner.",
"Your letter gratified Annalis very much, as shewing that you took an active interest in his concerns, and yet assisted him with exceedingly candid advice.",
"Publius Servilius the elder, from a letter which he said he had received from Caesar, declares himself highly obliged to you for having spoken with the greatest kindness and earnestness of his devotion to Caesar.",
"After my return to Rome from Arpinum I was told that Hippodamus had started to join you.",
"I cannot say that I was surprised at his having acted so discourteously as to start to join you without a letter from me: I only say that, that I was annoyed.",
"For I had long resolved, from an expression in your letter, that if I had anything I wished conveyed to you with more than usual care, I should give it to him: for, in truth, into a letter like this, which I send you in an ordinary way, I usually put nothing that, if it fell into certain hands, might be a source of annoyance.",
"I reserve myself for Minucius and Salvius and Labeo.",
"Labeo will either be starting late or will stay here altogether.",
"Hippodamus did not even ask me whether he could do anything for me.",
"T. Penarius sends me a kind letter about you: says that he is exceedingly charmed with your literary pursuits, conversation, and above all by your dinners.",
"He was always a favorite of mine, and I see a good deal of his brother.",
"Wherefore continue, as you have begun, to admit the young man to your intimacy.",
"From the fact of this letter having been in hand during many days, owing to the delay of the letter-carriers, I have jotted down in it many various things at odd times, as, for instance, the following: Titus Anicius has mentioned to me more than once that he would not hesitate to buy a suburban property for you, if he found one.",
"In these remarks of his I find two things surprising: first, that when you write to him about buying a suburban property, you not only don't write to me to that effect, but write even in a contrary sense; and, secondly, that in writing to him you totally forget his letters which you showed me at Tusculum, and as totally the rule of Epicharmus, "Notice how he has treated another": in fact, that you have quite forgotten, as I think, the lesson conveyed by the expression of his face, his conversation, and his spirit.",
"But this is your concern.",
"As to a suburban property, be sure to let me know your wishes, and at the same time take care that that fellow doesn't get you into trouble.",
"What else have I to say?",
"Anything?",
"Yes, there is this: Gabinius entered the city by night on the 27th of September, and today, at two o clock, when he ought to have appeared on his trial for lese majeste, in accordance with the edict of C. Alflus, he was all but crushed to the earth by a great and unanimous demonstration of the popular hatred.",
"Nothing could exceed his humiliating position.",
"However, Piso comes next to him.",
"So I think of introducing a marvelous episode into my second book--Apollo declaring in the council of the gods what sort of return that of the two commanders was to be, one of whom had lost, and the other sold his army.",
"From Britain I have a letter of Qesar's dated the 1st of September, which reached me on the 27th, satisfactory enough as far as the British expedition is concerned, in which, to prevent my wondering at not getting one from you, he tells me that you were not with him when he reached the coast.",
"To that letter I made no reply, not even a formal congratulation, on account of his mourning.",
"Many, many wishes, dear brother, for your health.",
"Yes, I saw well enough what your feelings were as I parted from you; what mine were I am my own witness.",
"This makes it all the mote incumbent on you to prevent an additional decree being passed, so that this mutual regret of ours may not last more than a year.",
"As to Annius Saturninus, your measures are excellent.",
"As to the guarantee, pray, during your stay at Rome, give it yourself.",
"You will find several guarantees on purchase, such as those of the estates of Memmius, or rather of Attilius.",
"As to Oppius, that is exactly what I wished, and especially your having engaged to pay him the 800 sestertia (about 6,400 pounds), which I am determined shall be paid in any case, even if I have to borrow to do so, rather than wait for the last day of getting in my own debts.",
"I now come to that last line of your letter written crossways, in which you give me a word of caution about your sister.",
"The facts of the matter are these.",
"On arriving at my place at Arpinum, my brother came to see me, and our first subject of conversation was yourself, and we discussed it at great length.",
"After this I brought the conversation round to what you and I had discussed at Tusculum, on the subject of your sister.",
"I never saw anything so gentle and placable as my brother was on that occasion in regard to your sister: so much so, indeed, that if there had been any cause of quarrel on the score of expense, it was not apparent.",
"So much for that day.",
"Next day we started from Arpinum.",
"A country festival caused Quintus to stop at Arcanum; I stopped at Aquinum; but we lunched at Arcanum.",
"You know his property there.",
"When we got there Quintus said, in the kindest manner, "Pomponia, do you ask the ladies in, I will invite the men."",
"Nothing, as I thought, could be more courteous, and that, too, not only in the actual words, but also in his intention and the expression of face.",
"But she, in the hearing of us all, exclaimed, "I am only a stranger here! "",
"The origin of that was, as I think, the fact that Statius had preceded us to look after the luncheon.",
"Thereupon Quintus said to me, "There, that's what I have to put up with every day!"",
"You will say, "Well, what does that amount to?"",
"A great deal, and, indeed, she had irritated even me: her answer had been given with such unnecessary acrimony, both of word and look.",
"I concealed my annoyance.",
"We all took our places at table except her.",
"However, Ouintus sent her dishes from the table, which she declined.",
"In short, I thought I never saw anything better tempered than my brother, or crosser than your sister: and there were many particulars which I omit that raised my bile more than did that of Quintus himself.",
"I then went on to Aquinum; Quintus stopped at Arcanum, and joined me early the next day at Aquinum.",
"He told me that she had refused to sleep with him, and when on the point of leaving she behaved just as I had seen her.",
"Need I say more?",
"You may tell her herself that in my judgment she showed a marked want of kindness on that day.",
"I have told you this story at greater length, perhaps, than was necessary, to convince you that you, too, have something to do in the way of giving her instruction and advice.",
"There only remains for me to beg you to complete all my commissions before leaving town; to give Pomptinus a push, and make him start; to let me know as soon as you have left town, and to believe that, by heaven, there is nothing I love and find more pleasure in than yourself.",
"I said a most affectionate good-bye to that best of men, A. Torquatus, at Minturnae, to whom I wish you would remark, in the course of conversation, that I have mentioned him in my letter.",
"Your own immense prestige and my unvarying belief in your consummate virtue have convinced me of the great importance it is to me that you should be acquainted with what I have accomplished, and that you should not be ignorant of the equity and disinterestedness with which I protected our allies and governed my province.",
"For if you knew these facts, I thought I should with greater ease secure your approval of my wishes.",
"Having entered my province on the last day of July, and seeing that the time of year made it necessary for me to make all haste to the army, I spent but two days at Laodicea, four at Apamea three at Synnada, and the same at Philomelium.",
"Having held largely attended assizes in these towns, I freed a great number of cities from very vexatious tributes, excessive interest, and fraudulent debt.",
"Again, the army having before my arrival been broken up by something like a mutiny, and five cohorts--without a legate or a military tribune, and, in fact, actually without a single centurion-- having taken up its quarters at Philomelium, while the rest of the army was in Lycaonia, I ordered my legate M. Anneius to bring those five cohorts to join the main army; and, having thus got the whole army together into one place, to pitch a camp at Iconium in Lycaonia.",
"This order having been energetically executed by him, I arrived at the camp myself on the 24th of August, having meanwhile, in accordance with the decree of the senate, collected in the intervening days a strong body of reserve men, a very adequate force of cavalry, and a contingent of volunteers from the free peoples and allied sovereigns.",
"While this was going on, and when, after reviewing the army, I had on the 28th of August begun my march to Cilicia, some legates sent to me by the sovereign of Commagene announced, with every sign of panic, yet not without some foundation, that the Parthians had entered Syria.",
"On hearing this I was rendered very anxious both for Syria and my own province, and, in fact, for all the rest of Asia.",
"Accordingly, I made up my mind that I must lead the army through the district of Cappadocia, which adjoins Cilicia.",
"For if I had gone straight down into Cilicia, I could easily indeed have held Cilicia itself, owing to the natural strength of Mount Amanus--for there are only two defiles opening into Cilicia from Syria, both of which are capable of being closed by insignificant garrisons owing to their narrowness, nor can anything be imagined better fortified than is Cilicia on the Syrian side--but I was disturbed for Cappadocia, which is quite open on the Syrian side, and is surrounded by kings, who, even if they are our friends in secret, nevertheless do not venture to be openly hostile to the Parthians.",
"Accordingly, I pitched my camp in the extreme south of Cappadocia at the town of Cybistra, not far from Mount Taurus, with the object at once of covering Cilicia, and of thwarting the designs of the neighboring tribes by holding Cappadocia.",
"Meanwhile, in the midst of this serious commotion and anxious expectation of a very formidable war king Deiotarus, who has with good reason been always highly honored in your judgment and my own, as well as that of the senate--a man distinguished for his goodwill and loyalty to the Roman people, as well as for his eminent courage and wisdom--sent legates to tell me that he was on his way to my camp in full force.",
"Much affected by his zeal and kindness, I sent him a letter of thanks, and urged him to hasten.",
"However, being detained at Cybistra five days while mats ring my plan of campaign, I rescued king Ariobarzanes, whose safety had been entrusted to me by the senate on your motion, from a plot that, to his surprise, had been formed against him: and I not only saved his life, but I took pains also to secure that his royal authority should be respected.",
"Metras and Athenus (the latter strongly commended to me by yourself), who had been exiled owing to the persistent enmity of queen Athenais, I restored to a position of the highest influence and favor with the king.",
"Then, as there was danger of serious hostilities arising in Cappadocia in case the priest, as it was thought likely that he would do, defended himself with arms--for he was a young man, well furnished with horse and foot and money, and relying on those all who desired political change of any sort--I contrived that he should leave the kingdom: and that the king, without civil war or an appeal to arms, with the full authority of the court thoroughly secured, should hold the kingdom with proper dignity.",
"Meanwhile.",
"I was informed by dispatches and messengers from many sides, that the Parthians and Arabs had approached the town of Antioch in great force, and that a large body of their horsemen, which had crossed into Cilicia, had been cut to pieces by some squadrons of my cavalry and the praetorian cohort then on garrison duty at Epiphanea- Wherefore, seeing that the forces of the Parthians had turned their backs upon Cappadocia, and were not far from the frontiers of Cilicia, I led my army to Anianus with the longest forced marches I could.",
"Arrived there, I learnt that the enemy had retired from Antioch, and that Bibulus was at Antioch.",
"I thereupon informed Deiotarus, who was hurrying to join me with a large and strong body of horse and foot, and with all the forces he could muster, that I saw no reason for his leaving his own do-minions, and that in case of any new event, I would immediately write and send to him.",
"And as my intention in coming had been to relieve both provinces, should occasion arise, so now I proceeded to do what I had all along made up my mind was greatly to the interest of both provinces, namely, to reduce Amanus, and to remove from that mountain an eternal enemy.",
"So I made a feint of retiring from the mountain and making for other parts of Cilicia: and having gone a day's march from Amanus and pitched a camp, on the 12th of October, towards evening, at Epiphanea, with my army in light marching order I effected such a night march, that by dawn on the 13th I was already ascending Amanus.",
"Having formed the cohorts and auxiliaries into several columns of attack--I and my legate Quintus (my brother) commanding one, my legate C. Pomptinus another, and my legates M. Anneius and L. Tullius the rest--we surprised most of the inhabitants, who, being cut off from all retreat, were killed or taken prisoners.",
"But Erana, which was more like a town than a village, and was the capital of Amanus, as also Sepyra and Commons, which offered a determined and protracted resistance from before daybreak till four in the afternoon--Pomptinus being in command in that part of Amanus--we took, after killing a great number of the enemy, and stormed and set fire to several fortresses.",
"After these operations we lay encamped for four days on the spurs of Amanus, near the Arce Alezandri, and all that time we devoted to the destruction of the remaining inhabitants of Amanus, and devastating their lands on that side of the mountain which belongs to my province.",
"Having accomplished this, I led the army away to Pindenissus, a town of the Eleutherocilices.",
"And since this town was situated on a very lofty and strongly fortified spot, and was inhabited by men who have never submitted even to the kings, and since they were offering harborage to deserters, and were eagerly expecting the arrival of the Parthians, I thought it of importance to the prestige of the empire to suppress their audacity, in order that there might be less difficulty in breaking the spirits of all such as were anywhere disaffected to our rule.",
"I encircled them with a stockade and trench: I beleaguered them with six forts and huge camps: I assaulted them by the aid of earth-works, pent-houses, and towers: and having employed numerous catapults and bowmen, with great personal labour, and without troubling the allies or costing them anything, I reduced them to such extremities that, after every region of their town had been battered down or fired, they surrendered to me on the fifty-seventh day.",
"Their next neighbors were the people of Tebra, no less predatory and audacious: from them after the capture of Pindenissus I received hostages.",
"I then dismissed the army to winter quarters; and I put my brother in command, with orders to station the men in villages that had either been captured or were disaffected.",
"Well now, I would have you feel convinced that, should a motion be brought before the senate on these matters, I shall consider that the highest possible compliment has been paid me, if you give your vote in favor of a mark of honor being bestowed upon me.",
"And as to this, though I am aware that in such matters men of the most respectable character are accustomed to ask and to be asked, yet I think in your case that it is rather a reminder than a request which is called for from me.",
"For it is you who have on very many occasions complimented me in votes which you delivered, who have praised me to the skies in conversation, in panegyric, in the most laudatory speeches in senate and public meeting: you are the man to whose words I ever attached such weight as to hold myself in possession of my utmost ambition, if your lips joined the chorus of my praise.",
"It was you finally, as I recollect, who said, when voting against a supplicatio in honor of a certain illustrious and noble person, that you would have voted for it, if the motion had related to what he had done in the city as consul.",
"It was you, too, who voted for granting me a supplicatio, though only a civilian, not as had been done in many instances, "for good services to the state," but, as I remember, "for having saved the state."",
"I pass over your having shared the hatred I excited, the dangers I ran, all the storms' that I have encountered, and your having been entirely ready to have shared them much more fully if I had allowed it; and finally your having regarded my enemy as your own; of whose death even--thus shewing me clearly how much you valued me--you manifested your approval by supporting the cause of Milo in the senate.",
"On the other hand, I have borne a testimony to you, which I do not regard as constituting any claim on your gratitude, but as a frank expression of genuine opinion: for I did not confine myself to a silent admiration of your eminent virtues--who does not admire them?",
"But in all forms of speech, whether in the senate or at the bar; in all kinds of writing, Greek or Latin; in fine, in all the various branches of my literary activity, I proclaimed your superiority not only to contemporaries, but also to those of whom we have heard in history.",
"You will ask, perhaps, why I place such value on this or that modicum of congratulation or compliment from the senate.",
"I will be frank with you, as our common tastes' and mutual good services, our close friendship, nay, the intimacy of our fathers demand.",
"If there ever was anyone by natural inclination, and still more, I think, by reason and reflexion, averse from the empty praise and comments of the vulgar, I am certainly the man.",
"Witness my consulship, in which, as in the rest of my life, I confess that I eagerly pursued the objects capable of producing true glory: mere glory for its own sake I never thought a subject for ambition.",
"Accordingly, I not only passed over a province after the votes for its outfit had been taken, but also with it an almost certain hope of a triumph; and finally the priesthood, though, as I think you will agree with me, I could have obtained it without much difficulty, I did not try to get.",
"Yet after my unjust disgrace--always stigmatized by you as a disaster to the Republic, and rather an honor than a disaster to myself--I was anxious that some very signal marks of the approbation of the senate and Roman people should be put on record.",
"Accordingly, in the first place, I did subsequently wish for the augurship, about which I had not troubled myself before; and the compliment usually paid by the senate in the case of success in war, though passed over by me in old times, I now think an object to be desired.",
"That you should approve and support this wish of mine, in which you may trace a strong desire to heal the wounds inflicted upon me by my disgrace, though I a little while ago declared that I would not ask it, I now do earnestly ask of you: but only on condition that you shall not think my humble services paltry and insignificant, but of such a nature and importance, that many for far less signal successes have obtained the highest honors from the senate.",
"I have, too, I think, noticed this--for you know how attentively I ever listen to you--that in granting or withholding honors you are accustomed to look not so much to the particular achievements as to the character, the principles' and conduct of commanders.",
"Well, if you apply this test to my case, you will find that, with a weak army, my strongest support against the threat of a very formidable war has been my equity and purity of conduct.",
"With these as my aids I accomplished what I never could have accomplished by any amount of legions: among the allies I have created the warmest devotion in place of the most extreme alienation; the most complete loyalty in place of the most dangerous disaffection; and their spirits fluttered by the prospect of change I have brought back to feelings of affection for the old rule.",
"But I have said too much of myself, especially to you, in whom singly the grievances of all our allies alike find a listener.",
"You will learn the truth from those who think themselves restored to life by my administration.",
"And while all with nearly one consent will praise me in your hearing as I most desire to be praised, so will your two chief client states--the island of Cyprus and the kingdom of Cappadocia--have something to say to you about me also.",
"So, too, I think, will Deiotarus, who is attached to you with special warmth.",
"Now, if these things are above the common run, and if in all ages it has been rarer to find men capable of conquering their own desires than capable of conquering an enemy's army, it is quite in harmony with your principles, when you find these rarer and more difficult virtues combined with success in war, to regard that success itself as more complete and glorious.",
"I have only one last resource--philosophy: and to make her plead for me, as though I doubted the efficacy of a mere request: philosophy, the best friend I have ever had in all my life, the greatest gift which has been bestowed by the gods upon mankind.",
"Yes!",
"this common sympathy in tastes and studies--our inseparable devotion and attachment to which from boyhood have caused us to become almost unique examples of men bringing that true and ancient philosophy (which some regard as only the employment of leisure and idleness) down to the forum, the council chamber, and the very camp itself--pleads the cause of my glory with you: and I do not think a Cato can, with a good conscience, say her nay.",
"Wherefore I would have you convince yourself that, if my despatch is made the ground of paying me this compliment with your concurrence, I shall consider that the dearest wish of my heart has been fulfilled owing at once to your influence and to your friendship."
